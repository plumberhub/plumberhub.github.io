<p>Organic particles, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's cable, snake or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself project. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
