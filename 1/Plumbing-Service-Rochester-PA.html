<p>In the first half of the twentieth century, a variety of products were utilized for home plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most typical metals, while clay was utilized for sewer line piping. Although all these materials are durable in the short-term, they deteriorate over years. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are prone to many different kinds of deterioration. After about fifty years, they'll begin to compromise from deterioration and may position toxins into the freshwater supply. We recommend replacing the iron, steel, and clay pipes in your home.

<p>Water that has been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been gotten rid of-- destructive. For this factor, WQA suggests that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) ought to not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not trigger this type of deterioration A softener is just recording some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations while doing so (typically salt or sometimes potassium).</p>
