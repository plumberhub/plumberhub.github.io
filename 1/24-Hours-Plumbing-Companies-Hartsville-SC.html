<h3>Cheap And Reliable Plumbers Hartsville SC</h3>
<p>A. Normally wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>Changing your flapper might require a little different steps than we reveal (Photos 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Finding a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the job if you have an uncommon flush valve. To find an ideal replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware store. (Shut off the water before eliminating the flapper.) You may not discover a similar match, however chances are you'll find one of the very same shape and size. If not, try a plumbing supply store (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>
