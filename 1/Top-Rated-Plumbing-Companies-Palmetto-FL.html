<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned up rapidly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, releasing from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to remove debris such as hard water scale, sand, silt, and grease deposits.</p>
<p>Plastic pipe is in wide usage for domestic water supply and drain-waste-vent (DWV) pipe. Principal types include: Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was produced experimentally in the 19th century but did not end up being practical to manufacture up until 1926, when Waldo Semon of BF Goodrich Co. developed an approach to plasticize PVC, making it easier to process. PVC pipe started to be produced in the 1940s and remained in broad usage for Drain-Waste-Vent piping throughout the restoration of Germany and Japan following WWII. In the 1950s, plastics makers in Western Europe and Japan began producing acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) pipe. The technique for producing cross-linked polyethylene (PEX) was likewise established in the 1950s. Plastic supply pipes have become significantly common, with a variety of fittings and products used.</p>
<p>Testing must be completed by a contractor registered with the Cross Connection Control office. The contractor must have a valid, current plumbing license, present insurance coverage, backflow preventer testing accreditation, and presently adjusted test set. For testing of fireline backflow preventers, the State's Fire Marshal certificate is required.</p>
