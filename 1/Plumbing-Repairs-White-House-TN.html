<p>It's Making sounds - As your water heats, there are minerals that are falling and separating to your tank's bottom. This will cause it to work more difficult and can produce noise. If your energy bills are increasing, a brand-new, higher efficiency water heater can bring them pull back. All that needs to be done is closing off the inlet and outlet valves of the softener and open the bypass valve, enabling hard water to stream to the tank and household taps. After that the softener can be detached, moved to its new place and positioned there.</p>
<p>Pro Idea: If you're going to be draining pipes a dishwasher through the system, now is the best time to eliminate the knockout plug inside the dishwasher inlet. Use a hammer to tap a screwdriver into the inlet up until the plug is broken off; obtain the small piece of plastic from inside the disposer. This is also the ideal time to make the connections for a hardwired unit with a pre-existing junction box.</p>
