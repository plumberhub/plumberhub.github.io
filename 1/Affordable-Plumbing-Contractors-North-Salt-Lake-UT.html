<h3>How To Keep A Blocked Toilet From Becoming A Plumbing Catastrophe at North Salt Lake UT 84054</h3>
<p>Your home's drainage works by the easy force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not actually the flow of water pressing them down your pipes. Instead, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. Anything you put down there will not go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>
