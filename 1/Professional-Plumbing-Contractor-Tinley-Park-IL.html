When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the community water system, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water held in the sprinkler system can end up being infected. If allowed to re-enter the water supply, there is potential for the contaminated water to become a health hazard.
