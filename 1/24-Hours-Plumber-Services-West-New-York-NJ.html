<p>If your old disposal is broken beyond repair, you'll need to replace it.

Depending upon the pro you deal with, it can be as much as half the price.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach optimal capacity and can't draw in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank can be found in. An on-board computer calculates the quantity of water that flows through the softener. Regeneration immediately begins when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom home and family of 4, regrowth usually occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
