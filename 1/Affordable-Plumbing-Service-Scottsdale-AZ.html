<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers and that may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no more repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my tenants tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not come back because he had another consultation. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>

<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. Over time, the deposits accumulate, until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits take place more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. You might have your drain pipes professionally cleaned if you desire to make twice as sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs, it's time for a new one.</p>
