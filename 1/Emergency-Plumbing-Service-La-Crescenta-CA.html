<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and guaranteed and meet our rigid trust accreditation standards. A good rule of thumb is to replace faucets that show deterioration, rust, fractures, and otherwise deep damages. Worn out and corroded parts make repairs pricey and hard, meaning a faucet installation is more beneficial. Repairs are the correct fix for problems such as missing out on or damaged washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other small elements of the entire component. If these replacements and repairs do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of replacing your faucet, then we advise a new faucet installation.</p>
