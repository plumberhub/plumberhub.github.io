<p>Now wait a minute, some individuals say, doesn't the water pressure in the water system keep the watering water from going backwards? Yes, the majority of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow takes place. No, it is not a regular incident, but it does take place more often than you believe! Typically it occurs in the evening when you don't discover the water was off for a few minutes. An example is when the water company needs to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or connect a brand-new pipe. This makes building and construction tasks easily the most typical reason for backflow problems. Fire combating is another common cause of backflow. Fire engine use substantial pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This frequently triggers the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will take place in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Testing must be finished by a contractor signed up with the Cross Connection Control workplace. The contractor needs to possess a valid, updated plumbing license, existing insurance, backflow preventer testing certification, and currently adjusted test kit. For testing of fireline backflow preventers, the State's Fire Marshal certificate is needed.</p>
