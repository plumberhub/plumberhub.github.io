<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and journey lever - tend to be the main focus of a lot of repairs, there are plenty of other small toilet parts that should also be well preserved to help avoid leakages and other toilet difficulties. For example, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense versus leakages in between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can start to crack and harden or just be so crushed that it doesn't fill the space in addition to it used to, and you wind up with water all over the location. Just like with the gasket, often your tank to bowl bolts and washers can end up being corroded or so worn that they spring a leak. We strongly recommend also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything is in great shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
