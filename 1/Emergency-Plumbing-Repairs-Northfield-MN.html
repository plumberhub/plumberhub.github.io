<p>As soon as a big sufficient source of water has been identified and examined, the 3rd significant component of a water supply system enters play: a system of pipelines to convey the water from its source to its customers. The biggest of these primary long-distance sending pipes are referred to as aqueducts. Normally constructed of large-diameter (10 feet or more) strengthened concrete pipe sectors, and even tunnels lined with an impermeable finish, these are substantial underground and aboveground pipes created to bring bulk circulation amounts of water to treatment plants, secondary storage centers and circulation nodes where the flows are transferred to smaller-sized branch circulation pipelines. A lot of big cities need a number of aqueducts providing water from geographically separated and diverse sources.</p>
