<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical procedure filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like material covered with favorably charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water flows through the unit while the resin releases its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>Repipers start by covering floors and furniture to protect them from water damage and dust during the work. They then locate the pipes in your walls with little cuts into the drywall of the walls and ceilings. They will just eliminate as much building product as needed to reach, separate, and eliminate the old pipe and replace it with new copper, PEX, or CPVC piping. To access pipes in the floor, plumbers will, whenever possible, enter through the ceiling listed below it. If you want, you can set up to have additional pipes put in at this time if you need to expand your water service for a remodel.</p>
