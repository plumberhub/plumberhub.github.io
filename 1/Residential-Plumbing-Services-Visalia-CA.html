<p>Template-Assisted Condensation: Shortened to TAC, this method uses resin beads as a catalytic nucleation site where firmness mineral ions are become a stable crystalline form that will not cling to surface areas. These crystals are tiny and flow typically through the water. Unlike with a softener that utilizes ion-exchange, this tank of resin beads does not need continuous regeneration.</p>

<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health threat for individuals on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral content.

More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in sodium is minor, but if you have actually been encouraged by a doctor to follow a stringent low salt diet plan this boost can posture problems.</p>
