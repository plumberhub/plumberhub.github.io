<p>Warning: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is utilized on the majority of rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts off. This is due to the fact that the pressure variations brought on by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water system. The likelihood of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless for the most part it must be much less water.</p>
<p>A cross-connection is any momentary or permanent connection in between a public water system or consumer's drinkable (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system consisting of nonpotable water or other compounds. An example is the piping in between a public water supply or customer's potable water system and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or watering system.</p>
