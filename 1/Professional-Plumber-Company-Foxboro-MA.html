<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber Foxboro MA</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the reason for clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's cable television, snake or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself job. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it's worth it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
