If you need pipes changed, you will need to work with a professional plumber. The cost of having actually pipes repaired or changed can vary considerably depending upon the location of the pipes, the actual problem, and the question of replacing or fixing; but on average, the cost to replace pipes is $80-$ 440 per hour or a repaired price of about $222.

<p>Backflow preventers are also required by the plumbing code. Except within Shoreline, the plumbing authority for Seattle Public Utilities consumers is King County plumbing (Public Health - Seattle & King County). The City of Shoreline is the plumbing authority within Coastline's city limits. Seattle Public Utilities works with both King County plumbing and the City of Coastline when it comes to backflow preventer requirements.</p>

For example, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems supplying dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water supply.
