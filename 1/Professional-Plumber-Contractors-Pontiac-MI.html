<p>Individuals who compose these posts must be considerate of the consumer and the professional service provider.

Once the FutureSoft water softener is set up, you will not have a slippery feel to the water as you would have with a salt-based water softener. This does not mean it's not working. FutureSoft is not including any sodium to the water and is retaining the important, healthy minerals in your water.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. Gradually, the deposits collect, till they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits occur more frequently when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. If you wish to make twice as sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it, you could have your drain pipes professionally cleaned up. It's time for a new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks.</p>
