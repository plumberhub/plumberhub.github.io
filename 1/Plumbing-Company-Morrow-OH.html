<p>Two designs of PVBs are readily available: (1) Pressure Vacuum Breaker and (2) Spill Resistant Vacuum Breaker. A PVB is a mechanical backflow prevention assembly that consists of an independently acting, spring-loaded check valve and an individually acting, spring-loaded, air inlet valve on the discharge side of the check valve. It includes shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is equipped with test dicks. A PVB might be used to separate health or non-health threats but works against back-siphonage only.</p>
