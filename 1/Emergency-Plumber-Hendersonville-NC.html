It's filled with small, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The salt water tank is where the sodium, or salt, is stored and combined with water. If you prepare to drain  your automated dishwasher through your disposer, find the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Remove it by carefully punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). If you will not use your system to drain a dishwasher, leave the breakout plate intact.</p>
