The biggest of these main long-distance sending pipes are described as aqueducts. Normally constructed of large-diameter (10 feet or more) strengthened concrete pipe segments, and even tunnels lined with an impermeable coating, these are big underground and aboveground pipes developed to bring bulk circulation amounts of water to treatment plants, secondary storage facilities and distribution nodes where the flows are transferred to smaller-sized branch distribution pipelines. Most big cities need a number of aqueducts providing water from geographically separated and diverse sources.</p>
