<p>It's Making Noise - As your water heats up, there are minerals that are separating and falling to your tank's bottom. This will trigger it to work more difficult and can develop noise. If your energy bills are rising, a new, greater performance hot water heater can bring them back down. All that needs to be done is shutting off the inlet and outlet valves of the softener and open the bypass valve, enabling hard water to stream to the storage tank and household taps. After that the softener can be detached, transferred to its brand-new area and put there.</p>

This typically costs an additional $50 to $100+. The pilot burner may need to be relit, the gas line might be clogged or need repair. If the gas line is damaged, the flowers or vegetation near the gas leak will be tarnished or degraded. Contact our professionals to determine the degree of the issue.</p>
