<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean water supply, backpressure backflow in a building results. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or decreased pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
