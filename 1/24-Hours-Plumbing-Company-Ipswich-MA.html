This can be a basic issue such as a broken water seal, or it can show a larger concern such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can prevent severe damage to your house.

<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound potable supply of water. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common kind of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
