<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when getting ahold of the firmness minerals. But the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is commonly imagined. If you have reasonably tough water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily sodium consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of salt added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
