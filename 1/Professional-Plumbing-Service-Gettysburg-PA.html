<p>A water softener eliminates minerals that develop water hardness, among the most typical water quality problems a homeowner encounters. Difficult water destroys devices, leaves cloudy soap residue throughout kitchens and bathrooms, and dries hair and skin. With over 85% of the United States relying on tough water for their cleaning, bathing, and cooking, water softeners serve a vital purpose. A water softener conserves you from changing prematurely destroyed water heaters, flaky faucet heads, and hours and hours of tidying up soapy residue. Purchasing a water softener saves you money, energy, and time, and protects your house and your residential or commercial property.</p>
<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He said he would change the washers and that may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no more repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. Because he had another appointment, they called him back and he stated he would not come back. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
