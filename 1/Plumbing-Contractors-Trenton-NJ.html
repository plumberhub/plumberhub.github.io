<p>Rust: The most common problem is deterioration in the tank and pipes that connect to your hot water heater.

Whether it's calcium, iron, or another component that is triggering the deterioration, you will eventually experience a leak in your hot water heater that is difficult to repair. Leaks frequently imply a new system replacement is in order.</p>
