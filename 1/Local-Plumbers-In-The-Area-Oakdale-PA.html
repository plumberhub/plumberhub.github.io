If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed issue. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a versatile water supply line. They're a lot easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make certain to get one that's covered with stainless-steel mesh. For a good seal, hold the hose so it intends straight into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the connectors. Make them handtight, then include another quarter turn with pliers. Connections that are too tight can really trigger leaks or spin the fill valve inside the tank. Look for leaks and tighten them a bit more if needed.</p>
