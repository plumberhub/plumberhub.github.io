<p>The bill for emergency plumbing is almost always a shock. Are plumbers simply capitalizing? Occasionally, but the brief period of the work adds to the high rates.

<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. Over time, the deposits build up, until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes.

If you wish to make twice as sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it, you could have your drain pipes expertly cleaned. It's time for a new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks.</p>
