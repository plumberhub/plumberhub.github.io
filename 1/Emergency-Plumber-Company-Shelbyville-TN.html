<h3>Plumbing, Drains & Water Cleanup Shelbyville TN</h3>
<p>In the 1990 ′ s, drought conditions motivated water providers to execute water preservation programs in California. In these programs, older 3.5 and 6.0 - gallons per flush toilet fixtures in residences were changed with 1.6 - gallons per flush designs. Constant clogs: If the plunger has become a routine component in your bathroom, it's time for a replacement. Continuous obstructions indicate your toilet no longer has the power needed to effectively eliminate waste with each flush.</p>
<p>Toilet repairs and replacements are a natural part of being a homeowner. You could sustain much more expensive property damage if you wait too long to call a plumber for toilet repairs. Even a sluggish leak can damage your subfloors and floorings - causing major repairs and even replacing the whole floor.
