For this factor, WQA recommends that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not trigger this type of deterioration A softener is merely recording some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations while doing so (generally sodium or sometimes potassium).</p>
