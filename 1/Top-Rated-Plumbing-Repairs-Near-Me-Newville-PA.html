<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of a lot of repairs, there are a lot of other small toilet parts that must also be well preserved to help avoid leakages and other toilet difficulties. For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense against leaks in between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can begin to break and solidify or simply be so crushed that it doesn't fill the space in addition to it used to, and you wind up with water all over the place. Much like with the gasket, often your tank to bowl washers and bolts can end up being corroded or so used that they spring a leak. We highly suggest also changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything is in tip-top shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
