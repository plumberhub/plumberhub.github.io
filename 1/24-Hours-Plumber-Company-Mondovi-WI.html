<p>Why risk an insurance coverage claim on a flooded house when picking a licensed and insured  plumbing contractor is simply a basic telephone call away. A malfunctioning toilet is one household problem most of us would rather prevent. However, you can not ignore a toilet issue.

<p>Light Blue = Reduced Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is minimized by the # 1 Check spring (for instance, to 90 psi). This pressure distinction throughout the # 1 check valve preserves the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>

<p>Backflow prevention secures drinkable water supply from possible dangers. There are over 10,000 reported cases of backflow contamination each year. Backflow gadgets are required by law and should be set up in accordance with plumbing or building regulations. There are several kinds of backflow preventers utilized in numerous applications.

<p>The new inlets and outlets on the tank don't constantly line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a set of 45-degree fittings to balance out each line if necessary. Also replace the old shutoff valve with a new ball valve while you're at it (Picture 6). Vent diameters are sized according to the heat output of the hot water heater. You might need to increase or reduce the vent size to ensure the best draft. CAUTION: If you're unsure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
