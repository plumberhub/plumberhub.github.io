<p>Dry pipe systems typically are set up in big, unheated locations, such as parking garages. These systems have pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler triggers due to heat, the air is released, enabling the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is released through the open sprinkler head to suppress the fire.</p>
