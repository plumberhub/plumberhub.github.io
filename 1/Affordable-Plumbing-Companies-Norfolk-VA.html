<p>If you are not 100% satisfied with the service we have offered, (barring cost) we will reimburse your money. If our plumbers smoke or are rude in your home, are not drug evaluated, or leave your house without tidying up, you do not pay for the service. If a repair or equipment that we have actually supplied and set up fails in the very first year, we will repair it again-no charge.</p>
<p>Dry pipe systems typically are set up in big, unheated locations, such as parking garages. These systems have pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler triggers due to heat, the air is released, enabling the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is released through the open sprinkler head to suppress the fire.</p>
