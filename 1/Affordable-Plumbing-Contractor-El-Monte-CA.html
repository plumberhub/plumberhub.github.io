<p>A freshly installed hot water heater must not produce unusual noises, but it will begin to produce rumbling noises as it ages. The sounds get louder gradually as the heater runs to heat up the water. Things worsen drastically for homes with a high demand for warm water.

If the water heater still produces rumbling sounds even after it has been flushed, a water heater replacement might be essential.</p>
