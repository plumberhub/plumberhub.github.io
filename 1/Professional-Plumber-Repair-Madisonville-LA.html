Continuous clogs: If the plunger has ended up being a routine fixture in your bathroom, it's time for a replacement. Continuous obstructions indicate your toilet no longer has actually the power needed to successfully get rid of waste with each flush.</p>
<p>Another way to handle a clog is by using a chemical cleaning item or if you fear they might be too severe on your pipes, you can attempt old home remedies like warm water, vinegar, and baking soda. If you've tried everything and the clog remains, call Plumb Perfect Plumbing and inquire about our clogged toilet repair service.
