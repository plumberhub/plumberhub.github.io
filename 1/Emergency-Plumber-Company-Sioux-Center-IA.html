<p>At Harry Clark Plumbing & Heating we focus on repiping for your house. Repiping is the process of changing the cold and hot water lines in your Bay Area house. We want to ensure that each and every house we go into has the correct plumbing services supplied. Softeners can run automatic, semi-automatic, or handbook. Each type is rated on the quantity of hardness it can remove prior to regeneration is required.</p>
<p>Hard water is brought on by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners treat the water by utilizing salt and ion-exchange resins to remove these minerals. When the water can be found in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions move out of the water and onto the active websites on the resin. Then they are changed in the service by the sodium ions.</p>
<p>Reverse osmosis uses an applied pressure gradient throughout a semi permeable membrane to overcome osmotic pressure and remove water particles from the solution with solidity ions. The membrane has pores large enough to admit water particles for passage; firmness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft supply of water is without firmness ions with no other ions being added. Membranes are a type of water filter needing routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
