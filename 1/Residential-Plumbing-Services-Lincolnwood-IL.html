<p>Here's what to anticipate on the day of your hot water heater installation consultation. Installing natural gas lines can bring a brand-new level of service. As tough water goes through the mineral tank, the beads inside bring in the positively-charged calcium and magnesium ions. The minerals that trigger tough water stay with the beads, and the treated water heads out into your house's plumbing system.</p>
