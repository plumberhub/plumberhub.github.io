<h3>Quality Plumbing Service Ashland VA</h3>
<p>Garbage disposals are an essential part of any modern kitchen. A waste disposal unit integrates the ease of a sink with the utility of a trash bin. Now you can just send out all our bigger food waste items into the garbage disposal and it will take care of the rest! In addition to a wide variety of plumbing services, we specialize in the installation and maintenance of waste disposal unit and will gladly assist you with whatever issues you are having.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. However the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is widely pictured. If you have moderately tough water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day sodium consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of salt added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
