<h3>Water Heater Installation and Repair Tips at Wamego KS 66547</h3>
<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one need to first consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener components. When these elements are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in difficult water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
