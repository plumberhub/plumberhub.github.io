<h3>Five Things To Do Today To Avoid A Clogged Toilet at Springfield MA 01109</h3>
<p>I bought a "Deal" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, since I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned up from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was just 9 months ago. I feel that rates were increased since I had a "Deal". An Angie's list article from March said depending upon the market and severity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my previous receipt to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
<p>Pointer: Both anti-siphon valves and pressure vacuum breakers can not avoid back-pressure. I recently had several plumbing leakages repaired and could not be better with the timely service I received from Parker and Sons. They are really well-informed, friendly, reasonably priced, and do quality work. I would definitely recommend them to my family and everyone. I would trust them to repair any leak in your house.</p>
