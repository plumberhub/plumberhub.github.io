<p>All you actually need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) as soon as you've found the trip lever you want eliminate your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and loosen it from the tank. Take your new journey lever, place it in the hole where your old trip lever was and protect it. Remember that because of the method a lever works, the locknuts for most toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the proper method. When you have actually secured the journey lever and are all set to link your flapper, make certain you have actually got simply enough slack in the chain to guarantee the flapper is sealing firmly over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the method when you push down on the trip lever.</p>
<p>The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, however it doesn't grind up food, this indicates the flywheel is stuck.

Set a container under the P-trap and detach the drainpipes. Then eliminate the sink strainer. Remove any excess putty.</p>
