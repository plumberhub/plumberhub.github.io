<p>We focus on storm drain inspections and cleaning. Many kitchen sink obstructions are due to heavy grease buildup and food particles. So, scrape those plates in the trash and use the disposal for the small particles that are left. Run cold water while running the disposal and you can rely on clear pipes and fresh smelling drains. Explore our water softener collection and enjoy much better water for bathing and appliances.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Reduced Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is lowered by the # 1 Check spring (for instance, to 90 psi). This pressure difference across the # 1 check valve keeps the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>
