<p>When you remove the cap to eliminate the valve, check the washer for wear or fractures. Replacing a bad washer is inexpensive and simple. But discovering the best washer might not be. The most common washers are often readily available in the house centers and hardware stores. Other styles can be tough to find. If you choose to hunt for a washer, eliminate it and take it to the store to find a match. Plumbers generally replace the entire fill valve instead of hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
