<p>Atmospheric Vacuum Breaker - Design GFAVB - The climatic vacuum breaker is one of the least pricey backflow prevention assembly. The GFAVB is a non-testable system and are good for back siphonage only for non-health threat or health risk conditions. They must be set up downstream from any shut down valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. , if an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on a watering system you must install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.. It should also be set up at least 6 inches (150 mm) higher than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB producers, and some local officials, need that they be set up 12 inches (300 mm) greater than the highest outlet). Some municipalities do not enable the usage of GFAVB's. These units will NOT prevent backflow pressure and can only protect versus back siphonage.</p>

The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use once backwashing is total.
