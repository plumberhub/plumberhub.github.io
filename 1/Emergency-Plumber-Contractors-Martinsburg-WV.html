<p>Backflow is the undesirable reversal of flow in a drinkable water distribution system. Water that is always under pressure can just flow in one direction. Then how can water flow in reverse?

<p>In some neighborhoods, home water softeners drain to municipal wastewater treatment plants, which are not developed to get rid of chloride. The chloride goes through the treatment plant and winds up in our streams and lakes. In houses with personal wells and home softeners, chloride drains to the house's septic system and after that ends up in lakes and streams.</p>
<p>Foul Sewer Odor: One of the first most obvious indications of a sewer problem is a smell of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the backyard (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be an easy issue such as a broken water seal, or it can suggest a larger issue such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can avoid severe damage to your home. Even if the issue stems with the local system, it's still smart to bring in the specialists to limit the damage to your home.</p>
<p>You are responsible for repairing or replacing the assembly within 30 days if your assembly fails the annual test. All replacements must be set up to Manatee County Utilities Standards and be the proper kind of assembly based on the conditions on your residential or commercial property (see area below "Needed Backflow Prevention Assemblies") In addition, the assembly should meet the lead complimentary requirement of Area 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300g-6) If you are still out of compliance after the thirty days, all water services will be stopped till the assembly is in compliance.</p>
