Whole-house models are proper for washing makers, or you can try laundry additive water softening products.</p>
<p>Responsive circulation technology works by continually bringing tanks online and off-line in response to the water demands of your carwash. For example, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation technology, only one of the four tanks is required to soften water when the carwash isn't hectic.
