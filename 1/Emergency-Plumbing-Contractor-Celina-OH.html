<h3>Top Rated Atlanta Plumber Celina OH</h3>
<p>A. Normally wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>During regeneration, the water softener will take the salt water option into the softener tank and the ion exchange process takes place once again, only this time in reverse. At the time of inspection, be sure to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can take a look at the entire system.
