<p>The easiest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc attached to an atmospheric vent. In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop listed below that of the outside air. This activates the disc to open, enabling air to restore and get in the valve pressure equivalent to ambient climatic standard. This remediation of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
