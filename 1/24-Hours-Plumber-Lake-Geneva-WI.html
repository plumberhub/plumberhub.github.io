<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adjust to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. Throughout periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's probably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
