<p>Oxidants such as chlorine in the public supply of water react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become brittle. This results in micro-fractures and lowers the basic structural stability of the system. The system ends up being weak and may fail without warning, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Incorrect installation is also a typical cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly difficult to detect.</p>
