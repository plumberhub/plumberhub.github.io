Back-siphonage can happen when there is a high velocity in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is decreased main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as throughout fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>
<p>Some pipe products are less expensive than others; some are more fragile and vulnerable to splitting, displacement or other types of structural failure.
