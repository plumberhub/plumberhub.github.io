<h3>Sewer and Drain Cleaning Tips in Blanchard OK 73010</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your service' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. During durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's probably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
