<p>Now wait a minute, some individuals say, doesn't the water pressure in the water system keep the watering water from reversing? Yes, most of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow occurs. No, it is not a frequent event, however it does take place more frequently than you think! When you don't see the water was off for a few minutes, often it takes place at night. An example is when the public utility needs to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or connect a brand-new pipe. This makes building jobs easily the most typical reason for backflow problems. Fire battling is another common reason for backflow. Fire trucks utilize big pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This frequently causes the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will occur in the surrounding communities.</p>
