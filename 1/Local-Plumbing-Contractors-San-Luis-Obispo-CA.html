<p>Nearly all softeners fall under one of two classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a fixed schedule and after that return to service. Since they restore whether the resin requires it or not, these work well for homes that are on regular water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt. Demand-control designs, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, usually regrow after so many gallons of water have been softened. If you have an ever-changing water use schedule, such designs are hassle-free.</p>
