<p>Codes: Minnesota State Plumbing Code Area 4714.0603.5.23 as well as Saint Paul Legal Code Area 94.18 require yearly testing of lowered pressure zone (RPZ) assemblies and testable check valve assemblies.

These gadgets are typically integrated into single items to increase their effectiveness, such as check valve assemblies (including 2 consecutive independent check valves (DCVA)) and Reverse-pressure concept backflow preventers (two inline check valves with a pressure relief valve situated in between them to dump out any backflow water (RPD)).</p>
<p>Now wait a minute, some people say, does not the water pressure in the water supply keep the watering water from going backwards? Yes, most of the time it does. Nevertheless, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow happens. No, it is not a regular occurrence, but it does happen regularly than you think! Typically it occurs in the evening when you do not discover the water was off for a couple of minutes. An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or hook up a new pipe. This makes building and construction projects quickly the most common reason for backflow problems. Fire fighting is another typical cause of backflow. Fire trucks utilize substantial pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This frequently triggers the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will occur in the surrounding communities.</p>
