Please trim back your plants and schedule testing with a company from our certified tester list This must be finished within 30 days to avoid water service interruption.</p>
<p>Before choice and installation, refer to makers literature for temperature varieties. All assemblies must be safeguarded from freezing temperature levels and if installed where temperatures will reach 100 degrees F or above, a warm water type assembly must be used.

<p>When the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean water supply, backpressure backflow in a building results. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical type of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
