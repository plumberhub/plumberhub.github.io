<h3>How to Fix a Leaky Faucet from the Kitchen in Bowdon GA 30108</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation need, tanks come online to include flow rate capability. Throughout durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's perhaps the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
