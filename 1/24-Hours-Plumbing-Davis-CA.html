<h3>Sewer and Drain Cleaning Tips in Davis CA 95616</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Deal" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, since I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned up from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was just 9 months back. I feel that costs were increased since I had a "Offer". An Angie's list post from March said depending on the market and intensity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Pity on me for not bringing my previous invoice to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>
