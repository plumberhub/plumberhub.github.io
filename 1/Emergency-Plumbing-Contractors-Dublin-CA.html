<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the firmness minerals. But the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is widely pictured. If you have reasonably hard water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day sodium intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of salt added by water softeners is minimal.</p>

<h3>Clearing Blocked Drains at Dublin CA 94568</h3>
<p>When compared to gas models, electric models are simpler and more economical to install as electricity is already readily available through the main power supply line. For gas water heaters, a particular gas line needs to be set up and a viable source of gas established. Another function of an electric water heater is that they do not need any ventilation. Gas models need to be ventilated correctly using vents and ducts in order to operate properly. With electric designs, you will not have to install any new vents or ducts in your house.</p>

Regardless of what the problem is, nevertheless, your hot water heater will not be able to operate up until the pilot burner is re-lit.</p>
