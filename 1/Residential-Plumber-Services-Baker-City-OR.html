After an inspection has been scheduled using the Permits and Inspections Online Permitting Service scheduling system, inspectors might be called between 8:00 am - 9:00 am the day of the inspection.

<p>Calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions that cause water firmness can be gotten rid of fairly quickly by using an ion exchange treatment. Basic water softeners are cation exchange devices.

Master plumbers will not charge for their services grossly excessive rates, or otherwise take undue benefit of an unsuspecting public.</p>
