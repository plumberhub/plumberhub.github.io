<p>Dry pipe systems usually are set up in big, unheated areas, such as parking garages. These systems have actually pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler activates due to heat, the air is released, allowing the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is released through the open sprinkler head to suppress the fire.</p>
<p>The issue of leakage can be credited to any number of elements which can range from the tank is old and worn out, to over-pressurization, along with bad maintenance. The hot water heater tank must have some room to account for the growth that takes place when heating the water. The thermal expansion needs to get away, for this reason the need for a growth tank to help regulate the pressure. The force applied by the expansion taking location when boiling the water causes the tank to crack and start leaking if the tank is old and used out.
