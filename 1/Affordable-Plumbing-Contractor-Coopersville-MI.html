<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers and that might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no more repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my tenants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Since he had another consultation, they called him back and he said he would not come back. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
<p>Single flush High Effectiveness Toilets (HETs) use 1.28 gallons per flush. The current double flush HET used by Bonney will use an average of 1.1 gallons per flush.

Appropriate care and garbage disposal maintenance will keep it running long past its service warranty and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
