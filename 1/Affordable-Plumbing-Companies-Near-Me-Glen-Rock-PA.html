For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense against leaks between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can start to break and harden or just be so squished that it doesn't fill the space as well as it used to, and you end up with water all over the location. Similar to with the gasket, sometimes your tank to bowl washers and bolts can become rusty or so used that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we strongly recommend also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything remains in tip-top shape.</p>
