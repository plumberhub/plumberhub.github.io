<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not recede versus the needed instructions of flow. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to ensure that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the municipal supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water kept in the sprinkler system can end up being contaminated. There is potential for the infected water to end up being a health risk if allowed to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined regularly for efficiency, as well as checked every year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a versatile supply of water line. They're a lot much easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing.

Make them handtight, then include another quarter turn with pliers. Links that are too tight can really trigger leaks or spin the fill valve inside the tank. Look for leakages and tighten them a bit more if needed.</p>
