<h3>When Hiring A Plumber, Always Confirm The Price And Warranty Lilburn GA</h3>
<p>A. Normally wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected issue. Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>In cold environments, soil, water or waste pipes need to not be set up outside of a house, in outside walls, in attics, or crawlspaces, or in another other location subjected to freezing temperature unless some arrangements are made to safeguard it from freezing by insulation or heat.
