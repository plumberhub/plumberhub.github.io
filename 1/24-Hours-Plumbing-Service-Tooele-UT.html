<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like material covered with favorably charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water streams through the unit while the resin launches its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
