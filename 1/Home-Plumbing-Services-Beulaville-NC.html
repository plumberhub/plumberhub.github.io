<p>Discover the best water softener for you. One common method for a home's water supply to be polluted is if the irrigation water lines, which might end up being tainted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines.

<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the firmness minerals. However the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is commonly thought of. If you have reasonably difficult water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily salt intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of salt added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
