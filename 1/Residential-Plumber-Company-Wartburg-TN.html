<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one must first think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener components. When these components are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions found in tough water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new sodium ions.</p>
