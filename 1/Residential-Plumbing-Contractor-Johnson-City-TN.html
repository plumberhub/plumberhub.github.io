Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity.
