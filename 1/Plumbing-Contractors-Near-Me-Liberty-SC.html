<p>If there are any lead pipes in the house, find out. Residences that were built prior to 1986 frequently have lead or galvanized plumbing.

You may not desire to live in a house that has lead pipes if you have kids.</p>
<p>You should also periodically inspect your hot water heater burner. The flame under the heater should appear blue with yellow pointers. If it's mostly yellow, or if it's sooty under there, your flue might be clogged, which is a hazardous circumstance. Contact a professional to inspect it out.
