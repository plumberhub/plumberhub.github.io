<p>Our Water Softeners Are Remarkably Created To Work.

This device includes no less than 5 independently running valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other four. Throughout basic water flows at style pressure, the 2 check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage occurs to the connected service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a advanced and reliable  (if expensive) device is best used in important areas where cross contamination might be a direct threat to life and health.</p>
