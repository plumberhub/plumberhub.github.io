<p>Sewer lines have one crucial role: bring wastewater out of a house or structure. Although these homeowners didn't feel fortunate at the time, it was certainly good timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe remained in sufficient shape to reline prior to the issue became worse. Waiting simply wasn't an option. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a removed garage. At the least, it would have been an extremely pricey choice.</p>
<p>Property owners frequently forego maintenance and care for their waste disposal unit. We merely expect this workhorse located under the sink to operate as planned when we require it. That's not the case, however. Like any good plumbing system, the waste disposal unit needs attention-- ideally, professional care.
