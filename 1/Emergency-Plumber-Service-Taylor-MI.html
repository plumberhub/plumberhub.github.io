<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health danger for individuals on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral material.

Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in salt is small, but if you've been recommended by a physician to follow a strict low sodium diet this boost can present problems.</p>

As the external finish of zinc starts to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
