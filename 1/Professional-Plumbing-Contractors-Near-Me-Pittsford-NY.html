An example is when the public utility has to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or attach a new pipe. This makes building and construction jobs easily the most common reason for backflow problems. Fire fighting is another common reason for backflow. Fire trucks use big pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants.
