<h3>Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning In Pleasantville NY</h3>
<p>Think of all the areas water flows in and out of your house. These are the locations that a professional evaluation must cover. That includes your piping, sinks, faucets, toilets, and other appliances. Even your water lines should be covered. While your water heater and toilets will receive unique attention, an experienced plumber seeks to examine the total health of your system. That means testing for proper water pressure. After all, excessive pressure can damage your plumbing, and too little can leave your home with inefficient water appliances.</p>
<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a great guy. He informed me exactly what to expect (cost, time, process) up front and delivered as guaranteed. I will definitely use Clog Dawg once again. Installing a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with an average hourly rate of $25 to $70. These rates are in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. If your plumber has a minimum callout cost that is greater than the labor cost for the work, the total you pay might be greater.</p>
