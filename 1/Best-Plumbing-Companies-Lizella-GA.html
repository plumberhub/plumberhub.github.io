This is a type of plastic resin that was commonly utilized by builders for houses integrated in the 1970s through the 1990s. The issue with this type of plastic piping is it can become brittle and break quickly, particularly if your water is chlorinated or chemically treated.</p>
<p>All you actually need to do is (CAREFULLY!) once you have actually found the trip lever you desire remove your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and loosen it from the tank. Take your new journey lever, place it in the hole where your old trip lever was and protect it. Bear in mind that because of the way a lever works, the locknuts for most toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the correct way. When you've secured the trip lever and are all set to attach your flapper, make sure you've got simply enough slack in the chain to make sure the flapper is sealing tightly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the way when you lower on the journey lever.</p>
