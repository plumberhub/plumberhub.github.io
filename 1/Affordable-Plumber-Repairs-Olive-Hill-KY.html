Contact your state's licensing board to find out more. No, but you may have to collaborate with a Vectren representative to access to your residential or commercial property to carry out service work, consisting of relighting your natural gas appliances.</p>

<p>The list of things a food disposer can take in is fairly short. Crisp or soft foods are great, however hard or stringy foods can be difficulty. Disposers can be stopped in their tracks by celery, eggshells and apple seeds, as well as the typical kitchen flotsam, including pop-tabs, scouring twist-ties and pads. While some older houses may not have backflow preventers, all newer residential or commercial properties are required to have them. If you're uncertain what kind of backflow preventers are utilized in your home or service, Doug's can help you find and recognize them. We can also perform your annual backflow inspections.</p>

<p>Single flush High Efficiency Toilets (HETs) utilize 1.28 gallons per flush. The latest double flush HET used by Bonney will use an average of 1.1 gallons per flush. This is where we disagree with InSinkErator. We suggest, as a lot of plumbers do, to use disposals sparingly. Correct care and waste disposal unit maintenance will keep it running long past its guarantee and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
