<p>In the very first half of the twentieth century, a variety of products were utilized for home plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most common metals, while clay was used for sewer line piping. Although all these products are resilient in the short-term, they deteriorate over decades. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are prone to many different types of corrosion. After about fifty years, they'll start to deteriorate from deterioration and might put toxic substances into the freshwater supply. We recommend changing the steel, clay, and iron pipes in your house.
