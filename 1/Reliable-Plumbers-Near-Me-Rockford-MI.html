<p>The issue of leak can be attributed to any number of factors which can vary from the tank is old and worn out, to over-pressurization, in addition to poor maintenance. When heating the water, the water heater tank need to have some room to account for the expansion that takes place. The thermal expansion needs to leave, hence the need for an expansion tank to help regulate the pressure. The force exerted by the growth taking place when boiling the water causes the tank to crack and begin leaking if the tank is old and worn out. The remedy for this is to replace the water heater system.</p>
