Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capability. Throughout periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's perhaps the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
