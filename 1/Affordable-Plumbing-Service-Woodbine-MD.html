Step 2: On the new drain, apply plumber's putty around the flange, and press it into location. Then lay a towel in the sink and set the disposal on the flange to keep it from moving. If you need garbage disposal repair, we can also help. One of our professionals will come out to find the problem and get your disposal operating in no time at all.</p>
