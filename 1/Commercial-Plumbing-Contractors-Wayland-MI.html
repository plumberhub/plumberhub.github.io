<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He said he would change the washers and that might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no additional repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my tenants tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not come back due to the fact that he had another consultation. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>

<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like material coated with positively charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water flows through the system while the resin launches its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
