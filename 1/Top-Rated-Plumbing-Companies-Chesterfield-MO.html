<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers which might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no additional repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my occupants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not return due to the fact that he had another visit. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
