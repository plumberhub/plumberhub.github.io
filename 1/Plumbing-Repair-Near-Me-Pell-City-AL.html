<p>Demand loads, no matter what their usage, need to be met by an effectively sized supply of water, which constitutes the second major element of a supply of water system. With sufficient storage tank capability to satisfy variable peak load need, the water system source can offer a stable circulation of water. Throughout hours of low need, the water flow can be used to fill up storage tanks, towers and tanks, which then provide water for emergency use and durations when need exceeds the standard pumping rate. A water supply source can take many forms, including groundwater extraction well fields, free-flowing rivers, manufactured or natural ponds, artesian springs, ocean water desalination plants, and rainwater run-off collection systems.</p>
<p>Plainly the resin is not an endless exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use as soon as backwashing is total. Some water softeners will automatically change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
