Instead of removing the blockage with negative pressure, it really pushes into the blockage, working further into where the blockage is taking place. The auger or snake" is then used to push the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear path for water to flow freely. The auger's corkscrew-shaped pointer helps force it further down into the clog, making it much easier to clear.</p>
