<p>Clearly the resin is not a limitless exchange website. When all the salt exchange sites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water.

The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize as soon as backwashing is total. Some water softeners will automatically change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
