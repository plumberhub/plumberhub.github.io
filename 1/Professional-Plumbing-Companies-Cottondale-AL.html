WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, offering the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>
