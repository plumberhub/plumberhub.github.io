<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Immediate toilet repair is very important to the safety of your clients and staff members. From commercial toilet drain service to unclogging commercial toilets, Roto-Rooter plumbers can do it all. Slide the new water heater into place, recut or extend the old tubing to meet the new, and solder the tubing together using copper slip couplings. If the tubing doesn't line up, balance out the lines as required with sets of 45-degree elbows.</p>
<p>To link a power cord to the new unit, get rid of the electrical cover plate on the bottom of the disposer and sign up with the colored wires found inside with their counterparts in the cable, utilizing wire nuts. The green ground wire is looped under the green screw on the unit. This can be done at any point prior to installation. Plumbing plans are not required for one- and two-family houses or townhouses, as defined in the California Residential Code, and their accessory structures.</p>
