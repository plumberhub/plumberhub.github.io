<p>This post intends to address the typical misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes rust This is not the case: an effectively set up water softener does not make the cured water more destructive. Here are a couple of complicated truths that typically lead individuals to this incorrect conclusion. Initially, naturally soft water is normally destructive. Therefore, softened water must likewise be destructive, best? This is a misconception because naturally soft water tends to be corrosive due to low pH and low TDS, while cation -exchange softening causes neither of these conditions.</p>

<h3>Water Heater Leaking at Chickasha OK 73018? How to Diagnose and Fix the Problem Fast!</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capability. Throughout durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's perhaps the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
<p>Rust: The most typical problem is rust in the tank and pipes that link to your hot water heater.
