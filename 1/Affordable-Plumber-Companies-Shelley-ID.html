<p>All you really need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) when you've found the journey lever you desire remove your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your brand-new journey lever, place it in the hole where your old journey lever was and protect it. Bear in mind that because of the way a lever works, the locknuts for the majority of toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the right way.

Suggestion: Location a heavy object such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving throughout installation.

Attempting to clean the pipes or deal with the water with chemicals will not fix the problem, as the pipes are weakening slowly from the within. Most of the times, repiping is your only practical option.</p>
