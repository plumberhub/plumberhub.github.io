<p>We provide emergency drain repair services for cracked and breached drain lines that will assist you to prevent potentially larger problems in the future. Leaky and cracked drains waste water that ends up costing you money as well as damaging the environment. Stopping these leaks and repairing broken pipes is specifically crucial in an area as drought-stricken as Los Angeles where summertime water allotments are low, and expenses are high.</p>
<p>Difficult water is caused by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners deal with the water by using salt and ion-exchange resins to eliminate these minerals. When the water comes in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions transfer out of the water and onto the active websites on the resin. Then they are replaced in the option by the salt ions.</p>

If needed, Cal's Plumbing has the skill and knowledge to locate existing cleanouts or to install one. Our professional plumbers have a vast range of experience carrying out quality cleanouts and have the qualifications to ensure the highest possible quality. We not just get results, but also offer you responses to why your drain clogged and how to prevent it from occurring in the future.</p>
