<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code protects the public water system and personal on-site water system and circulation systems by restricting cross-connections in between safe and clean (appropriate for drinking) and non-potable water systems, and by needing installation of secondary and primary backflow prevention techniques. Secondary backflow methods provide an increased level of protection for the public water system system.</p>
<p>Oxidants such as chlorine in the public supply of water respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become fragile. This leads to micro-fractures and minimizes the basic structural stability of the system.

Improper installation is also a typical cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly difficult to discover.</p>
