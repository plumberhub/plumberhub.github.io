<p>Then attach the drain (and dishwasher hose, if applicable). If your system is outlet-ready-- focus on this part-- make certain your disposal switch is in the off" position prior to you plug the brand-new system in.

<p>Regularly sharpening the blades. To clean and sharpen the blades, all you need to do is grind a couple of ice in the disposal before running cold water through the system. 3.
