<p>If you see a smell or unpleasant odor coming from your unit, which is not unusual, consider buying a flange that can seal up and cover the top of the disposal, where foul smells can get away. These flanges are easy and commonly available to install, costing around $30 in your home enhancement or hardware stores. Switch off the water supply to your house at the main line. To prevent leakages from springing during the installation process, shut off the water system to your home.
