<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of many repairs, there are plenty of other little toilet parts that must also be well kept to assist prevent leaks and other toilet troubles. For instance, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense against leakages in between the tank and bowl.

For that reason, all backflow prevention assemblies need to be checked regularly to guarantee that they are functioning correctly. Mechanical backflow prevention assemblies have to be tested with effectively adjusted gauge devices.</p>
