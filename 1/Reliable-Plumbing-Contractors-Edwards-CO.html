<p>In some neighborhoods, home water softeners drain to community wastewater treatment plants, which are not designed to remove chloride.

<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound drinkable supply of water. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or decreased pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical type of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
