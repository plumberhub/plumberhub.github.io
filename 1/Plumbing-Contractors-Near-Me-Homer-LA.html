<h3>Clearing Blocked Drains in Homer LA 71040</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Offer" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed estimate to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, because I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) which was just 9 months back. I feel that costs were increased due to the fact that I had a "Deal". An Angie's list article from March stated depending on the marketplace and intensity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my previous invoice to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
<p>If your old sink flange is undamaged and tight, with no signs of leak, you can most likely leave it in location. Opportunities are excellent that the mounting brackets on the new system will fit just fine. To find out, remove the old disposal and install the brand-new flange on it. If it fits, you can install the new disposal utilizing the old flange.</p>

We will provide you with options for repair or replacement and advise the best service depending on your specific needs. For double-bowl sinks, the best way to tackle things is to use a constant waste disposer kit including a discharge tube, baffle tee, and tailpiece. Such kits direct both drains to a single trap. Depending upon the location of the stub out, you'll need either an end outlet or center outlet package.</p>
