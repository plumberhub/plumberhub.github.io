<p>2 styles of PVBs are offered: (1) Pressure Vacuum Breaker and (2) Spill Resistant Vacuum Breaker. A PVB is a mechanical backflow prevention assembly that consists of an independently acting, spring-loaded check valve and an individually acting, spring-loaded, air inlet valve on the discharge side of the check valve. It consists of shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is equipped with test dicks. A PVB might be utilized to separate health or non-health risks but works versus back-siphonage only.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach maximum capacity and can't draw in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be regenerated, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank comes in. An on-board computer system determines the amount of water that streams through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration instantly begins. For a three-bedroom house and family of four, regeneration typically occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
