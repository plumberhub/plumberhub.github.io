<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers and that might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no further repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my tenants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Since he had another visit, they called him back and he said he would not come back. A best bad plumber story.</p>

Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and remain suspended in the water instead of developing on surfaces. Nevertheless, if they remain in one location for long, as they may in a hot water heater, the buildup could still occur.</p>
