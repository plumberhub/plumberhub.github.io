Repeating leaks and repairs. If your water heater is over ten years old, it has likely lost much of its effectiveness; continuing to repair it, with its frequent breakdowns, is not affordable in the long run.

<p>Check the disposal. Turn the power back on, run water into the sink and turn on the disposal to make sure it works. Inspect below to be sure there aren't any leakages.

Galvanized steel pipes need to be eliminated by a professional plumber when found and replaced with another pipe material.</p>
