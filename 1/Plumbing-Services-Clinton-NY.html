<p>Milwaukee, WI - Oct. 12, 2017 - SofTap Water, Inc., a Cincinnati water innovation start-up, and a graduate of The Water Council's BREW Corporate Accelerator program in Milwaukee WI, announced today they have achieved an advancement in water softening treatment utilizing an exclusive Surface Accelerated Formation (SACr) innovation.

<p>A few of the reasons for drain line clogs in kitchen drains are years of drain build-up, a stopping working garbage disposal, or too much food being gotten rid of down the drain. We will normally advise our PowerSnake or ZOOM Jetting ® services, depending on the severity of the circumstance. Provide us a call if your kitchen drain has raised water levels, is making gurgling noises, smells foul, or is slow to drain.</p>
