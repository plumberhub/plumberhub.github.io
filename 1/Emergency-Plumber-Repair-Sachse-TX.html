<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather reasonable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super delighted with their service.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another method is to introduce a chemical compound that acts as a chelating representative. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating representative and stay suspended in the water instead of developing on surfaces. Nevertheless, if they remain in one location for long, as they may in a hot water heater, the accumulation might still happen.</p>

<p>Iron or manganese fouling: Iron or manganese that has been exposed to air or chlorine can clog the resin and prevent it from working. This is referred to as fouling. In some cases it may be needed to filter the water before it gets to your softener to avoid fouling. If the resin becomes fouled, commercial cleaners are offered. Cleaners need to be utilized according to maker directions to prevent contamination.</p>
<p>Water softening refers to the elimination of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular method of water softening is through a procedure called ion exchange. During ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another type of ion-- usually sodium. The result is water that's been efficiently softened by eliminating nearly all traces of the minerals that constitute tough water.</p>
