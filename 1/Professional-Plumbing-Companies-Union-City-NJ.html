<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He said he would change the washers which may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no more repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not come back since he had another appointment. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
