Get cleaner clothes, eliminate rust areas, and utilize less detergent when you soften your laundry water.

<p>Responsive flow technology works by continually bringing tanks off-line and on-line in action to the water needs of your carwash. For example, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive flow technology, only one of the four tanks is needed to soften water when the carwash isn't hectic. However, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill. This responsive design permits the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than traditional single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
<p>The EcoWater ESS1152 Series are non-resin based systems that can be personalized to your water needs. Your EcoWater Pro will test your water to identify the ideal water treatment for your house.

The CareSoft ® system was established with the exact same innovative engineering as the Pro and Elite designs, with resin that delivers high-performance firmness removal you can depend on for years to come.</p>
