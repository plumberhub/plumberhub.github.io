Your circulation rate will continue to restrict and you risk losing water pressure throughout the house if scale continues to build up in your pipes. Tough water devastations water heaters, and without a softener, your utility expenses will continue to barrel skyward. If your supply of water is hard, the perpetual cycle of repairs and replacements will continue until your house is protected by a water softener.</p>
