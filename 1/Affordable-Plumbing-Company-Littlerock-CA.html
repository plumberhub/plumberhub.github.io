<h3>Blocked Drains in Littlerock CA 93543 - Various Tools Used</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Offer" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, since I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned up from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was just 9 months back. I feel that costs were increased because I had a "Deal". An Angie's list article from March said depending upon the market and severity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my previous invoice to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
<p>If your old sink flange is tight and intact, without any indications of leak, you can most likely leave it in place. Possibilities are good that the mounting brackets on the brand-new system will fit just fine. To find out, get rid of the old disposal and install the new flange on it. If it fits, you can install the new disposal using the old flange.</p>
<p>All of the drains in your home, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your house then leave into the sewer or septic system from your house. When you experience blockages in multiple drains at the same time in your home, then that normally means that your main sewer line is backing up. This can take place in several places and any mix of drains. For example, water may fill in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are several combinations of this kind of backup. The point is your drains all link, and as soon as you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overruning from several drain lines in your home.</p>
