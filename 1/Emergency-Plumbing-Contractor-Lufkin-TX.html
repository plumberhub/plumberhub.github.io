<h3>Residential Plumbing Emergencies Lufkin TX</h3>
<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Call your local gas utility company right away if a natural gas line is harmed when digging outside of the home. Eliminate the drain basket and surround the sink hole with a coil of plumber. The majority of plumbers are qualified to install disposals, however if a GFCI outlet is needed, an electrician might likewise be required.

You might also see the Plumbing Inspector Area Map link for the inspector in your area or call 651-266-8989. Plumbing Inspectors are available from 7:30 am - 9:00 am Monday through Friday.</p>
