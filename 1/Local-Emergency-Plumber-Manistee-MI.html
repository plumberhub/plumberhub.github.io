When a sprinkler activates due to heat, the air is released, allowing the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is discharged through the open sprinkler head to suppress the fire.</p>

<p>In the typical repair, the old rubber parts should be eliminated and replaced with new rubber parts. It is important that only original factory repair parts are utilized when putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts. The rubber parts the maker produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was designed to use and changing the rubber from the original factory parts will impact the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
