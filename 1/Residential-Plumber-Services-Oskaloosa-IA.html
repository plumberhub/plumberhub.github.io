Most of the times, the homeowner is accountable for maintaining the service line from the home to the curb, and the City is accountable for keeping the mainline sewer and the part of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>

<h3>Plumber Plumbing Contractor Oskaloosa IA</h3>
<p>A newly set up hot water heater should not produce strange sounds, however it will begin to produce rumbling sounds as it ages. The noises get louder with time as the heater goes to warm the water. Things worsen dramatically for homes with a high demand for warm water. The factors for the sounds can be the accumulation of sediments in the tank which need to be flushed to bring back normalcy. A water heater replacement might be required if the water heater still produces rumbling noises even after it has been flushed.</p>
