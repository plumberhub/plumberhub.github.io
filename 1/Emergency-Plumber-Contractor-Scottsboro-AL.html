<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Immediate toilet repair is important to the safety of your customers and staff members. From commercial toilet drain service to unclogging commercial toilets, Roto-Rooter plumbers can do it all. Slide the new water heater into place, recut or extend the old tubing to satisfy the new, and solder the tubing together utilizing copper slip couplings. Offset the lines as needed with sets of 45-degree elbows if the tubing doesn't line up.</p>
<p>Another irritating problem is when the flush valve in the tank stops working or wears out. If you hear the toilet running constantly or periodically you probably need the valve or float changed.
