<p>Leak detection is a component of water conservation that depends on highly technical expertise and customized devices to recognize the location of leakages throughout the city's water circulation system and identify the place of those leakages at which noticeable water might or might not have actually surfaced. Water temperature issues can be repaired by changing the temperature level on the hot water heater. Low water pressure from a sink faucet may be triggered by a blocked aerator screen. House owners can simply loosen the aerator screen from the faucet to clean out minerals or other deposits. If the shutoff valves under the sink are not open all the way, water pressure can also be low.</p>
