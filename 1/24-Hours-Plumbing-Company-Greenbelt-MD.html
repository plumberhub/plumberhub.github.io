<h3>Pipe Repair in Greenbelt Maryland</h2>
<p>Lots of homeowners will see a clog and right away grab a bottle of store-bought, chemical drain cleaner. While this type of chemical might do the job, it's really quite damaging to your pipes. Chemical drain cleaners frequently use lye as the active ingredient. Lye is developed to penetrate blockages and dissolve them, but it also eats through your pipes and produces weak spots that are susceptible to rupture.</p>
<p>Some pipe materials are less expensive than others; some are more susceptible and brittle to cracking, displacement or other kinds of structural failure. Other products are prone to deterioration and rust while some are untouched. Specific pipe products have greater coefficients of heat pressure, making them more susceptible to structural tensions and stress as a result of temperature level change and ice formation. And these distinctions dictate the potential need for backflow preventers.</p>
