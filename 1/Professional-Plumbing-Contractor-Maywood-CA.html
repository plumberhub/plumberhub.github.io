The pipe was in sufficient shape to reline before the problem got worse. Waiting just wasn't an alternative. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a detached garage. At the least, it would have been a very pricey choice.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are typically the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends on the level of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
