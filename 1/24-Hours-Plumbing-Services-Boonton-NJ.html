<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers and that might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no additional repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my tenants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not return because he had another visit. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
<p>The area under your kitchen sink has gotten more congested over the years. Initially, there would have been a cold and hot water line going up to the faucet (typically with shut-off valves for each) and a single drain pipe with a curved trap. Utilizing liquid epoxy-resin solutions, trenchless specialists can cure in-place whole brand-new sections of pipe within your damaged line, by means of small or perhaps pre-existing entry points.</p>
