We have 300% more chemicals that exceed nationwide health standards, and a even high percentage of toxins in our water that the national average. On top of that our typical water solidity level is between 18-23 grains per gallon of water or for simpleness reasons "very tough water".</p>
<p>It is possible to acquire disposal treatments that can help clean it and keep it odor free if your system frequently establishes odors. They cost around $8 per treatment bottle.

<p>Warning: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on a lot of rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts off. Since the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water system, this is. The possibility of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least lower, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however for the most part it should be much less water.</p>
