<p>We're replacing a natural gas hot water heater in our demonstration. The actions for changing a propane hot water heater are exactly the same, and those for an electrical water heater are similar. Repeating leaks and repairs. If your hot water heater is over 10 years old, it has actually likely lost much of its efficiency; continuing to repair it, with its frequent breakdowns, is not affordable in the long run. As a result, we advise changing your unit if it is over ten years old.</p>
