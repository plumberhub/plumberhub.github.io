<p>All you truly need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) when you've found the journey lever you want eliminate your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and loosen it from the tank. Take your new trip lever, place it in the hole where your old journey lever was and secure it. Remember that because of the way a lever works, the locknuts for the majority of toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so be sure you're turning things the proper method. When you've secured the trip lever and are all set to connect your flapper, make certain you've got just enough slack in the chain to make sure the flapper is sealing securely over the flush valve yet is still raising all the way when you lower on the trip lever.</p>
