No issue is too great for our extremely trained plumbers. From a sink replacement, to a faucet repair or upgrade, our experienced plumbing group gets the job done rapidly and cost effectively.</p>
<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you don't scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Picture 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on certain new sinks, but these will be labeled to that effect. Utilize a non-water-based silicone if you can't use plumber's putty. When you tighten up the locknut in place, excess putty will squeeze out between the new basket strainer and the sink. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to insert the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without catching on the gasket.</p>
