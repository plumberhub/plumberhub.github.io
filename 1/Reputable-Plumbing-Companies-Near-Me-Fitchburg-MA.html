<p>The leak from a pipe fitting that costs less than a dollar can easily cause countless dollars in water damage, interrupt your household for weeks, and throw your remodel way off schedule. So working with a licensed, insured master plumber (or a trained apprentice working under his license) is a no-brainer. However not all plumbers deal with all types of work. Their duties break out into two classifications: Plumbers who manage basic repairs (frequently in emergency scenarios), and plumbers who focus on remodeling additions and jobs.</p>

<p>2 designs of PVBs are available: (1) Pressure Vacuum Breaker and (2) Spill Resistant Vacuum Breaker. A PVB is a mechanical backflow prevention assembly that includes an independently acting, spring-loaded check valve and an independently acting, spring-loaded, air inlet valve on the discharge side of the check valve. It consists of shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is geared up with test cocks. A PVB may be utilized to isolate health or non-health dangers but works versus back-siphonage only.</p>
