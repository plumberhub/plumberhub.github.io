Your water will taste better. The minerals in tough water can trigger a bad smell and taste. It removes the mineral material to produce odorless drinking water that tastes excellent when you add a water softener.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach maximum capacity and can't draw in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be regenerated, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank can be found in. An on-board computer system computes the amount of water that flows through the softener. Regeneration automatically begins when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom home and family of 4, regeneration typically occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
