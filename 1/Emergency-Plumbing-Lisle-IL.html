<p>The normal option is to have the faulty pipes changed when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is an alternative to consider if you live in an older house - such as one built pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for many years, but steel ultimately suffers from deterioration and lacks the toughness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
