When water service is disrupted in the street or in a structure for any reason, there is a pressure drop which can draw infected water in reverse into the water supply.

This pressure difference across the # 1 check valve maintains the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>
