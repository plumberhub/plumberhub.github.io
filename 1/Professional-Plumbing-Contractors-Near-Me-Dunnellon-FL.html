<p>The secret to the innovation is having the ability to control both the crystal development rate and their elimination from our polymer beads, thus getting rid of hardness ions and producing a water softening benefit that does not require replacement chemicals or regeneration of active sites," specified Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and primary innovation officer. This technology is more cost reliable and lasts longer than typical water softening items such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
