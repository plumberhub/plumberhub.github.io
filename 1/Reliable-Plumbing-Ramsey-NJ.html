When your water lines are repiped, it simply implies old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with brand-new pipes. We find that homes 15 years or older who have actually never had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. If you have an older home and are experiencing significant and regular leaks, you might be in need of water line repiping. We discover that repiping can really be the cheaper and much better long-term solution if you do have regular leaks.</p>
