<h3>Tips On Basic Plumbing Emergencies Jenks OK</h3>
<p>A. Generally wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered problem. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>From the above description of the working of a toilet, you can see that it is comprised of numerous mechanical parts which, with time, undergo wear and tear and might need to be replaced.
