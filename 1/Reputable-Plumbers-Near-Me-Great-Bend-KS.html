<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow need, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. During periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>

In this approach, water is treated with a calculated quantity of washing soda (Na2CO3) which converts the chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium into their particular carbonates which get sped up.</p>
