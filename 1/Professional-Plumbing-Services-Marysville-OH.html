<p>Video cameras are among the most valuable tools in the plumbing business. Figure out the size of the pipes in the home and around the home - they will assist to figure out the water pressure that you'll have.

The pipes themselves should be at least a 1/2" in size to supply sufficient flow.</p>
<p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency, cross-connections can be a major public health risk if they do not have appropriate backflow prevention assemblies set up.

Again, the best kind of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub.
