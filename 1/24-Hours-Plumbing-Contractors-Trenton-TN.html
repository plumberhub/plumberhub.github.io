<h3>Water Heater Repair: When to Do It Yourself, and When to Call the Pros in Trenton TN 38382</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your company' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's perhaps the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
