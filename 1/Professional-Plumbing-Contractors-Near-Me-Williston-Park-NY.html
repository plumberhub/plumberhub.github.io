Changes in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will prompt a properly functioning RPZ assembly to regularly release percentages of water. Throughout a backflow condition, a large volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be installed in areas based on water damage. Adequate drainage must likewise be supplied.</p>
