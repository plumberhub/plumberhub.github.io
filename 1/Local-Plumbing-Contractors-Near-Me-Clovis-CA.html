The temperature and pressure relief valve is a security device that limits tank pressure and keeps it from blowing up (Picture 4). A brand-new one need to be included with every installation. For the valve to work effectively, the discharge pipe must be kept free of obstructions (Fig. A).</p>
<p>Now wait a minute, some people state, doesn't the water pressure in the water supply keep the irrigation water from going backwards? Yes, most of the time it does. Nevertheless, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow takes place. No, it is not a frequent occurrence, but it does occur more frequently than you believe! Often it happens at night when you don't observe the water was off for a few minutes. An example is when the water company needs to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or hook up a brand-new pipe. This makes building tasks quickly the most typical reason for backflow problems. Fire fighting is another common reason for backflow. Fire trucks utilize substantial pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This often causes the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will occur in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>

To repair your pipes, we utilize remote cams to check and determine the source of the concern rapidly and efficiently.
