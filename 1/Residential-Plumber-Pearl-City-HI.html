If you take a look at your house's plumbing pipes and see discolorations, staining, flaking, small imprints or rust, your pipes are rusting. Wearing away pipes are more likely to spring a leak (if they have not already) and need to be changed as quickly as possible.</p>

These work well for households that are on regular water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt since they restore whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control designs, with either mechanical and electrical sensing units, usually regenerate after so many gallons of water have been softened. If you have a fluctuating water use schedule, such models are convenient.</p>
