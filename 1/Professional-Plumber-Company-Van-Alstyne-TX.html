<p>Blending evaporated salt with rock salt is not suggested, as this might clog the softening reservoir. It is recommended that you enable your unit to go empty of one type of salt before adding another to avoid the occurrence of any problems.

And ensure a plumbing or electrical inspector checks your work.</p>
<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you don't scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Picture 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on certain new sinks, but these will be identified to that impact. Use a non-water-based silicone if you can't utilize plumber's putty. When you tighten the locknut in location, excess putty will squeeze out in between the new basket strainer and the sink. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Ensure to insert the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
