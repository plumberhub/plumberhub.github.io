When purchasing a home or flat, having a plumbing inspection is quite basic. If it's a leasing I have actually not seen a plumbing inspection done.  Again I have actually not seen electrical take any sort of precidence over plumbing. In reality, if not done it can be one of the most costly repair projects if overlooked.
