Attach the backup ring, the fiber or rubber gasket and the mounting ring to the flange from beneath the sink. Ensure you snap the backup ring in location.</p>
<p>When you have actually found the journey lever you desire, all you truly need to do is (CAREFULLY!) remove your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your new trip lever, place it in the hole where your old trip lever was and secure it. Bear in mind that due to the fact that of the method a lever works, the locknuts for a lot of toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the right way. When you've secured the journey lever and are all set to attach your flapper, make certain you have actually got just enough slack in the chain to make sure the flapper is sealing securely over the flush valve yet is still raising all the way when you push down on the journey lever.</p>

We will present you with alternatives for repair or replacement and advise the very best service depending on your particular needs.
