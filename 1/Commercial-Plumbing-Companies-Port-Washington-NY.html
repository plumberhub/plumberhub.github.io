Although these homeowners didn't feel fortunate at the time, it was certainly excellent timing to camera the line prior to collapsing.

At the least, it would have been a very pricey alternative.</p>

You may have to increase or reduce the vent size to ensure the best draft. CAUTION: If you're unsure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
