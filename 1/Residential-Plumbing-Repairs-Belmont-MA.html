<p>When the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound potable water supply, backpressure backflow in a building results. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water supply pressure.

To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common kind of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
