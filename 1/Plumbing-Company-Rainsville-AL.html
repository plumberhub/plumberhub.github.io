One way to test for any leaks in your plumbing is to turn off all water appliances in the house and outdoors (sprinklers, tubes, etc.). Then locate and enjoy the numbers on your house's water meter. If the numbers go up after 20-30 minutes, you have a leak. And the quicker those numbers increase, the larger the leak.</p>
<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years old and you have to work with a plumber for that burner set. The total repair expense may be in the $300 variety. A gas hot water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical water heaters cost about $400 to $800). That repair bill is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. Opt for the new heater.</p>
