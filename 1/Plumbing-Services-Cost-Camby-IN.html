<p>Learn if there are any lead pipes in the house. Residences that were developed prior to 1986 frequently have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you understand, no matter how beneficial, is an ecological toxin (note the need for unleaded gas and paint in houses that is not lead based). If you have kids, you might not want to live in a house that has lead pipes.</p>
<p>Pro Idea: If you're going to be draining pipes a dishwasher through the unit, now is the best time to get rid of the knockout plug inside the dishwasher inlet.
