<h3>Drain Maintenance in Troutman North Carolina</h2>

This eliminates the need for a backflow preventer, since every time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>

Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or reduced pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical type of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
