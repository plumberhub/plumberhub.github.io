<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming drinkable supply of water. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical type of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
