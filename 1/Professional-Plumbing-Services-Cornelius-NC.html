<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic.

<h3>Helpful Tips For Selecting A Reputable, Budget Friendly Plumber Cornelius NC</h3>
<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undetected issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Not all toilet problems require the assistance of a professional. Some minor blockages can be looked after with a plunger and often, when the toilet will not stop running, it's a basic matter of replacing the chain on the flapper valve inside the tank. Nevertheless, particular issues do call for a skilled plumber, and it is essential to understand the difference to avoid squandered money, disappointment, and time.</p>
