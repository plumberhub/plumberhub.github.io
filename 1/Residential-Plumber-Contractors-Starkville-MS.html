A PVB is a mechanical backflow prevention assembly that includes a separately acting, spring-loaded check valve and an individually acting, spring-loaded, air inlet valve on the discharge side of the check valve. It consists of shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is geared up with test dicks. A PVB may be utilized to isolate health or non-health dangers but is effective against back-siphonage only.</p>

<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. In time, the deposits build up, until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes. These deposits happen more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. If you want to make doubly sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it, you might have your drain pipes professionally cleaned. It's time for a new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks.</p>
