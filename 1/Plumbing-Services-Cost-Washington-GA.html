<h3>Most Typical Plumbing Services Washington GA</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's snake, drain or cable television auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a newbie's DIY task. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
