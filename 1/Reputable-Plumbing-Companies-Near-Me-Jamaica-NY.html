<p>Your home's drainage works by the easy force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not really the flow of water pressing them down your pipes.

When something obstructs the pipes, anything you put down there won't go through.</p>
<p>If your old sink flange is intact and tight, without any signs of leak, you can probably leave it in location. Chances are great that the installing brackets on the new unit will fit simply fine.
