At this point, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use once backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
