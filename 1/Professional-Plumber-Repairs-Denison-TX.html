<h3>Golden Rules To Follow In Plumbing Emergencies Denison TX</h3>

When galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is also worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact between the different metals.
