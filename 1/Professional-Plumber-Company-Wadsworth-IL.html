<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbing Wadsworth IL</h3>
<p>Minerals in water are what makes sure water considered hard." Calcium and magnesium are the most common minerals found in water. Generally, minerals get there because groundwater will dissolve rock like limestone, or metals, like iron and the remnants take a trip with the water up until it remains in your home. Water softening utilizes an ion exchange process to get rid of dissolved minerals that aren't as efficiently eliminated by mechanical filtration. These materials are what causes hard water.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release salt into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. However the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is commonly pictured. If you have reasonably difficult water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday sodium intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of sodium included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
