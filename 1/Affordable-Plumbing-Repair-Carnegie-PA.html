<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers and that might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no further repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my renters attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not come back because he had another consultation.

On top of that, you will get a repair estimate and you can negotiate a discount with the sellers to cover the unexpected expenditures.</p>
<p>Check the disposal. Turn the power back on, run water into the sink and switch on the disposal to make sure it works. Check below to be sure there aren't any leaks.

Pipes made of galvanized steel are no longer used in brand-new homes, however lots of houses constructed in between the 1930s - 1980s still have them.
