The City requires backflow prevention gadgets to be installed anywhere there exists a connection that might allow tainted water into the City system or personal plumbing. These gadgets go through testing by a certified backflow prevention assembly tester upon installation. In many cases, they are subject to periodic tests later on, also.</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions also enable options to backflow preventers. For instance, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems supplying devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water system. This gets rid of the need for a backflow preventer, since every time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
<p>There are more than 17,000 backflow prevention assemblies on water services in our service area. The California Department of Health Services requires each of these assemblies to be tested annually. This testing is done by backflow assembly testers authorized by the Orange County Healthcare Company. A list of the certified testers is readily available online.
