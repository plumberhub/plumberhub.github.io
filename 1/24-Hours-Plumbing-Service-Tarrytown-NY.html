<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of the majority of repairs, there are plenty of other little toilet parts that need to likewise be well preserved to assist prevent leaks and other toilet problems. For example, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense versus leakages between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can begin to split and harden or simply be so crushed that it doesn't fill the space as well as it used to, and you wind up with water all over the place. Much like with the gasket, sometimes your tank to bowl bolts and washers can end up being so used or corroded that they spring a leak. We highly recommend also changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything is in good shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
<p>There are fractures in the porcelain. It can lead to a leak if you see hairline or larger fractures developing in the bowl or tank of your toilet.

You may not want to live in a home that has lead pipes if you have kids.</p>
<p>Gas lines can be unsafe, and it's always best to tackle any problems with the help of a professional. Homeowners need to never attempt to fix a gas line on their own. One little error can cause a surge or a fire. There's no need to position everybody under your roof in threat and expose them to a possibly disastrous situation. Always work with the assistance of an expert.</p>
