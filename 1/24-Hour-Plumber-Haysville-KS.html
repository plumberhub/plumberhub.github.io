Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Typically, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to begin with. More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in salt is small, but if you've been advised by a medical professional to follow a strict low sodium diet this boost can pose problems.</p>
