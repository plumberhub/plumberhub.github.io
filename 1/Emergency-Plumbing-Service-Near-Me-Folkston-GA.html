<h3>Things To Consider Before Hiring A Plumber Folkston GA</h3>
<p>A. Generally wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered issue. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>If your issue is more associated to scale and mineral accumulation, it is essential to be mindful that many scale and mineral accumulation in toilet bowls is triggered by difficult water. Difficult water usually leaves lime and calcium accumulation which can become rather unsightly. While phosphoric acid and other cleaning methods will certainly assist, we strongly recommend you look into setting up a water softener to help with your hard water.</p>
