<p>In some communities, home water softeners drain to local wastewater treatment plants, which are not created to eliminate chloride.

Rather of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers and that might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no additional repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my tenants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Since he had another appointment, they called him back and he stated he would not come back. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
