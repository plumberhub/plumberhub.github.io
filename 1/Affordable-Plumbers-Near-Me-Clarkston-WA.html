<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and insured and meet our rigid trust accreditation requirements. A good general rule is to replace faucets that reveal deterioration, rust, fractures, and otherwise deep damages. Run-down and corroded parts make repairs difficult and costly, meaning a faucet installation is more beneficial. Repairs are the correct fix for issues such as missing or harmed washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other small components of the entire component. If these repairs and replacements do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of replacing your faucet, then we recommend a new faucet installation.</p>
