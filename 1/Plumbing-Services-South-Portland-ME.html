Your home is over ten years old, and you have actually never had the sewer and drain lines inspected. Some plumbers may get professional discounts from sellers or kitchen and bath display rooms. If you need a new sink or faucet, compare their costs with what you can find online or in the house enhancement shops. They might be getting you a better offer</p>
<p>To make placing a toilet easier, brand-new toilet bolts are extra long. That indicates you have to cut off the protruding ends later with a hacksaw.
