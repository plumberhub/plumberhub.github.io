<h3>Do You Need Water Heater Repair in Marion IN 46953?</h3>
<p>Water that has been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been eliminated-- corrosive. For this factor, WQA suggests that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not trigger this type of deterioration A softener is merely capturing some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (normally salt or in some cases potassium).</p>
