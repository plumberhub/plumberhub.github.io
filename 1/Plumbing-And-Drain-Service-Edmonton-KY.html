<p>In some neighborhoods, house water softeners drain to local wastewater treatment plants, which are not developed to get rid of chloride. The chloride passes through the treatment plant and winds up in our lakes and streams.

<p>Some house owners may consider water softeners as a luxury item, something that's nice to have" but not entirely needed. Nevertheless, difficult water can trigger everything from small inconveniences, like spots on meals or soap scum, to significant problems like a shorter life expectancy for your water heater, dishwasher, and other essential home devices.
