Keep an eye out for several clogged drains in your house, overruning or supported toilets, or water spots on your walls and structure.</p>
<p>Remove all parts of the disposer kit from package, and arrange the contents. Eliminate the P-trap and existing drain basket assembly carefully from the sink (Images 1 and 2). Place a big pan below the sink to capture water that might spill when you detach the drain, and keep a towel close by to clean up spills.
