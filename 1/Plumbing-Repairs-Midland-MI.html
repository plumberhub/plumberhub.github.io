<p>The concern of leak can be attributed to any number of elements which can range from the tank is old and worn, to over-pressurization, as well as poor maintenance. When heating the water, the water heater tank need to have some room to account for the expansion that takes location. The thermal growth needs to escape, for this reason the need for a growth tank to assist regulate the pressure. The force exerted by the expansion taking location when boiling the water causes the reservoir to crack and begin leaking if the tank is old and worn out. The solution for this is to replace the hot water heater unit.</p>
