<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather affordable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super happy with their service.</p>
