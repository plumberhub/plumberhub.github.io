<p>Disposers attach to the sink drain fittings in a number of ways-some use threaded plastic nuts, others big hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly shown here is the most typical. To eliminate the disposer, support it from listed below and turn the big, 3-tab mounting ring on top counterclockwise until the unit falls away. Remove the rest of the drain assembly by loosening the 3 bolts and spying off the retaining ring. Press the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
