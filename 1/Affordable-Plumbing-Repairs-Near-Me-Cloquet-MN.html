<p>Once you've discovered the trip lever you want, all you truly need to do is (CAREFULLY!) remove your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and loosen it from the tank. Take your brand-new trip lever, location it in the hole where your old trip lever was and secure it. Bear in mind that due to the fact that of the method a lever works, the locknuts for many toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the proper method. When you have actually protected the trip lever and are all set to attach your flapper, make sure you have actually got simply enough slack in the chain to make sure the flapper is sealing securely over the flush valve yet is still raising all the method when you lower on the journey lever.</p>
