<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. But the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is commonly pictured. If you have moderately difficult water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water.
