<h3>How to Clear Clogged Drains Without Calling a Plumber in Orono ME 04473</h3>
<p>When compared to gas models, electric designs are much easier and less costly to install as electricity is already available through the main power supply line. For gas water heaters, a particular gas line has to be installed and a practical source of gas established. Another feature of an electric hot water heater is that they do not require any ventilation. Gas models need to be aerated appropriately using vents and ducts in order to work properly. With electric designs, you will not need to install any brand-new vents or ducts in your home.</p>
