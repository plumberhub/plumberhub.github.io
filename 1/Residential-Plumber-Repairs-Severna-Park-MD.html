Replacing old pipes in a 1,500 square foot, two-bathroom house expenses $4,000 to $10,000, and requires cutting open walls and floors, so you certainly do not wish to do the job prior to it's required. Here's how to evaluate your plumbing system and know when it's time for replacement.</p>
<p>You hear water dripping or running in the tank. When water runs backward through your pipes and into the drinking water system, a backflow happens. The water streaming backwards from a cross-connection may infect the drinking water supply. Yard watering systems, pool, and jacuzzis are common cross-connection points.

<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. Gradually, the deposits build up, until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits occur more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. You might have your drain pipes professionally cleaned up if you want to make doubly sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it. It's time for a new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs.</p>
