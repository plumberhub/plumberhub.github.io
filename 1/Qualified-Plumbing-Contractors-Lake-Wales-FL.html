<p>Safeguard your house from leakages. There are numerous things that you need to think about to help you decide when you need a hot water heater replacement.

<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Photo 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on specific new sinks, but these will be identified to that result. If you can't use plumber's putty, use a non-water-based silicone. Excess putty will eject in between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten the locknut in place. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to place the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
