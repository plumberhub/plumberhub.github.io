<p>The majority of property owners have traditional water heaters that come with a tank where hot water is stored.

During hours of low need, the water flow can be utilized to refill storage tanks, tanks and towers, which then provide water for emergency use and durations when demand surpasses the standard pumping rate. A water supply source can take many kinds, including groundwater extraction well fields, free-flowing rivers, natural or man-made ponds, artesian springs, ocean water desalination plants, and rainwater run-off collection systems.</p>
