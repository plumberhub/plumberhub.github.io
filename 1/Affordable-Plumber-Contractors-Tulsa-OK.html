<p>You'll have to replace it if your old disposal is broken beyond repair. Although any broken device is frustrating to deal with, the bright side is that installing a replacement disposal will be cheaper than setting up a new waste disposal unit in a sink that has never had one previously. Depending on the pro you deal with, it can be as much as half the cost.</p>
<p>Dry pipe systems typically are set up in large, unheated locations, such as parking garages. These systems have pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler triggers due to heat, the air is launched, allowing the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is released through the open sprinkler head to suppress the fire.</p>

Homeowner responsibility starts from the meter on.
