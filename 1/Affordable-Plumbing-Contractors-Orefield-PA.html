<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release salt into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. However the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is commonly pictured. If you have reasonably tough water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day salt consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of salt included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
