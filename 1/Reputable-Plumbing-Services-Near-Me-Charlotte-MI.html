<p>Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite reasonable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>
