<p>Fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water functions should have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. These water functions are considered a health hazard if backflows occur from them. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and location must be shown on construction strategies. Any backflow preventer set up on a fountain or garden pond need to be tested upon installation and then yearly.</p>
<p>Pictures supplied by the American Backflow Prevention Association. The cost to repipe a house with copper pipe is in between $8,000 and $16,000 or about $3 to $8 per linear foot. Changing galvanized drain, waste, and vent pipe with copper costs $13 to $15 per direct foot. Copper pipe is more pricey than PEX, however it has some excellent advantages.
