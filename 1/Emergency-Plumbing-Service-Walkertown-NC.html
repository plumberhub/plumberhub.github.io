They are more secure to use than continuous feed disposals, however are not suggested for homes that create a lot of food waste.

<p>How much is a sewer line inspection? These specialized assessments consist of specialized camera equipment that encounters your sewer line.

<p>For shallow pipes with no close-by energies or obstructions, digging through and replacing the pipe manually would likely be more affordable than relining it internally.

Set a pail under the P-trap and disconnect the drains. Then get rid of the sink strainer. Remove any excess putty.</p>
