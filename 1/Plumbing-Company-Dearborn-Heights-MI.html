<h3>How To Repair Your Water Heater in Dearborn Heights MI 48127</h3>
<p>Water that has been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been removed-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA recommends that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not trigger this type of rust A softener is merely capturing some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations in the process (usually sodium or in some cases potassium).</p>
