<h3>Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning In Dingmans Ferry PA</h3>
<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not recede versus the required direction of flow. When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the community water supply, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can become polluted. There is potential for the contaminated water to become a health danger if allowed to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is planned to prevent water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked routinely for effectiveness, along with inspected yearly by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
