Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your service' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. Throughout durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
