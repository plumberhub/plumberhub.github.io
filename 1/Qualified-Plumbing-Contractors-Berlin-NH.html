<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some parts might have extremely tight tolerances that have to be preserved. An essential thing to determine on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the part. The guide is a very crucial part of the design of each element. If the component is not fixed effectively, the guide might limit the movement (instead of constant or direct) of the element, which could trigger the part to not work to its capabilities. Often times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the element causing lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
