<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical procedure filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like product coated with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water flows through the unit while the resin releases its sodium ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
