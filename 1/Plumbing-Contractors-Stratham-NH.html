Continuous feed disposals are simple to run: you run water in the kitchen sink, flip a switch, and feed the disposal with food scraps and compostable waste. With this type of garbage disposal, however, bottle caps, flatware, and other metal particles can sometimes get caught in the blades. This can harm the blades and require repairs.</p>
