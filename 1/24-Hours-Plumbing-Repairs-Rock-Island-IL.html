<h3>Most Useful Tools For De-Clogging in Rock Island IL 61201</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capacity. During durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
