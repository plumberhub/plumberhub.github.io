<p>Hidden water leakages are typically demanding and have Potentially Severe Repercussions. When it rains, any excess water is expected to decrease a storm drain in order to prevent flooding problems. If you are presently experiencing any flooding on your property when it rains, then there is a good chance that the storm drain is clogged and therefore needs to be cleaned out. If a clogged storm drain is not resolved in a prompt way, the chances are high that it will trigger extra damage to the storm pipe, which will need repair.</p>
<p>When to repair: Toilet blockages are not unusual, but if your toilet is clogging more than 3 times a month, there's a larger problem to take a look at. You may need to switch toilet paper or work with a plumber to clear an obstruction from the drain if your toilet is reasonably new. The National Contractor License Service preserves a list of each state's professional licensing agency where you can look up your state's licensing information. Examine the list of state licensing companies to learn whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List also preserves a licensing tool to inspect state licensing requirements.</p>
