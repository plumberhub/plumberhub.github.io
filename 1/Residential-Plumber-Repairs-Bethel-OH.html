<h3>Water Heater Leaking in Bethel OH 45106? How to Diagnose and Fix the Problem Fast!</h3>
<p>I bought a "Offer" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written estimate to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, considering that I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) which was only 9 months back. I feel that costs were increased since I had a "Offer". An Angie's list post from March said depending on the marketplace and severity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my previous invoice to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>

<p>Depending on the size of your home, repiping may take anywhere from a number of days to a week. Normally, it is possible to do the bulk of the work that needs complete water turned off while you are out and about throughout the day, so you experience minimal disruption to your day-to-day routine. To start the repiping process, the plumbing team will first cover any carpet and furnishings to protect them from dust and particles. They will then make little cuts in the wall and drywall to find the pipes and after that remove and replace them, leaving as much of the initial structure product as possible intact.</p>
