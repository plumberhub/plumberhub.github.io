<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health risk for people on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Generally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to begin with. More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in salt is minor, however if you've been recommended by a medical professional to follow a strict low sodium diet plan this boost can present problems.</p>
