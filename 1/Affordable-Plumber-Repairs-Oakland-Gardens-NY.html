<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one ought to initially think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener parts. When these components are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
