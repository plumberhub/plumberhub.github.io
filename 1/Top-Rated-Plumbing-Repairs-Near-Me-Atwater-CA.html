<p>Physical strength. Plumbers, pipefitters, and steamfitters should be able to lift and move heavy tools and products. Idea: Place a heavy object such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving during installation. Loosen the clamp and eliminate the dishwasher drain hose from the disposal. Trying to clean the pipes or deal with the water with chemicals will not fix the issue, as the pipes are weakening slowly from the inside.
