<p>When a large adequate source of water has been recognized and assessed, the third significant element of a supply of water system comes into play: a system of pipelines to convey the water from its source to its customers. The largest of these primary long-distance sending pipes are referred to as aqueducts. Usually constructed of large-diameter (10 feet or more) reinforced concrete pipe segments, and even tunnels lined with an impermeable finishing, these are big underground and aboveground pipes developed to carry bulk circulation quantities of water to treatment plants, secondary storage centers and distribution nodes where the circulations are moved to smaller-sized branch distribution pipelines. Most big cities need several aqueducts providing water from geographically separated and diverse sources.</p>
