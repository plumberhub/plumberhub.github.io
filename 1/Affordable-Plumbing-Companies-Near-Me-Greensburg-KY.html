<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adjust to your service' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow need, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capacity. Throughout periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
