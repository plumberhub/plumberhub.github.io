At that time, individuals had no concept that the lead in the pipes could leach into the drinking water, not to mention the health dangers connected with lead.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Reduced Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is decreased by the # 1 Examine spring (for example, to 90 psi).

If pressure in the Zone rises toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>
