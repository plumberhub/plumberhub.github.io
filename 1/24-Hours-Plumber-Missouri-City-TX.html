For gas hot water heater, a specific gas line needs to be set up and a viable source of gas established. Another function of an electrical hot water heater is that they do not require any ventilation. Gas designs need to be aerated properly utilizing vents and ducts in order to function correctly. With electric designs, you will not have to install any brand-new vents or ducts in your home.</p>
