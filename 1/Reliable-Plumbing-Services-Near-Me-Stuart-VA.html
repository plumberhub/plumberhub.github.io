<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not recede against the needed direction of flow. When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is utilized to guarantee that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the community supply of water, or other source of drinking water.

The backflow preventer is planned to prevent water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected regularly for efficiency, as well as inspected every year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
