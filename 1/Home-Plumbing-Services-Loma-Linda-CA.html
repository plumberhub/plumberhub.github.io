<p>Backflow is the undesirable reversal of flow in a potable water distribution system. Water that is always under pressure can just stream in one direction. Then how can water circulation in reverse? Water will always flow towards the point of most affordable pressure. If a water pipe were to break or if the fire department opened a number of fire hydrants to assist battle a fire, the pressure in the water pipe might drop. The need upstream might trigger a turnaround in flow.</p>

Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

<p>As with kitchen sink drains, a bathroom drain (whether it's your bathtub, shower, or sink) can be corrected quickly if the clog is shallow and easy.
