<p>Your sewer line is one of the most essential parts of your household plumbing - and if it ends up being broken or clogged, it could wreak undesirable problems on your property. A house's service line (also known as a sewer lateral) runs from the house to the mainline sewer in the street. In many cases, the homeowner is responsible for maintaining the service line from the home to the curb, and the City is responsible for keeping the mainline sewer and the portion of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Minimized Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is decreased by the # 1 Examine spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure distinction throughout the # 1 check valve preserves the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>

Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water system pressure.
