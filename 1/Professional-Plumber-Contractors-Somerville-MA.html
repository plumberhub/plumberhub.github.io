<h3>24 Hour Plumber & Water Heater Services Somerville MA</h3>
<p>A newly installed water heater should not produce strange sounds, however it will begin to create rumbling sounds as it ages. The sounds get louder in time as the heater runs to heat the water. Things get worse dramatically for homes with a high need for hot water. The reasons for the sounds can be the buildup of sediments in the tank which should be flushed to bring back normalcy. If the water heater still produces rumbling sounds even after it has actually been flushed, a water heater replacement may be necessary.</p>
<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a versatile supply of water line. They're a lot much easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make sure to get one that's covered with stainless-steel mesh. For a good seal, hold the hose so it aims directly into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the connectors. Make them handtight, then add another quarter turn with pliers. Connections that are too tight can in fact cause leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. If required, inspect for leaks and tighten them a bit more.</p>
