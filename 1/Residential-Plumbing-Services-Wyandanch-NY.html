<p>Responsive flow innovation works by continually bringing tanks off-line and online in reaction to the water needs of your carwash. For example, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive flow innovation, only one of the 4 tanks is required to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. However, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill. This responsive style permits the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than conventional single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
