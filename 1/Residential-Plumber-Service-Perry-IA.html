<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers which might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no more repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my tenants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Since he had another consultation, they called him back and he stated he would not come back. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>

Knowing the right order for disassembly of the backflow preventer can be important.</p>
