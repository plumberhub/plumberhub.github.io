<p>Whether you need waste disposal unit repair or installation, Maeser can help. A waste disposal unit is an important kitchen appliance in a lot of houses today. While most kitchen sink disposers can deal with almost any kind of food waste, they are not unbreakable. When a fork, bone or other item jams the impeller or shredding ring, the disposal will stop running. Used impellers on older disposals can become inefficient, increasing the risk of drain obstructions.</p>
