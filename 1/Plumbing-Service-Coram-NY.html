<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He said he would change the washers which might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no further repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not return because he had another visit. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
<p>The space under your kitchen sink has gotten more crowded throughout the years. Initially, there would have been a hot and cold  water line going up to the faucet (usually with shut-off valves for each) and a single drain pipe with a curved trap. Utilizing liquid epoxy-resin solutions, trenchless professionals can cure in-place whole new areas of pipe within your damaged line, through little or even pre-existing entry points.</p>
