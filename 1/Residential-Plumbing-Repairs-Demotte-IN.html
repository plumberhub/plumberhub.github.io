It is very important that the plumbing system be switched on very gradually to assure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air needs to be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system must be inspected to make sure no valves were inadvertently left open or did not close properly. When the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are entirely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>

<p>Need loads, no matter what their usage, need to be met by a properly sized water system, which constitutes the 2nd significant element of a water supply system. With sufficient storage tank capability to meet variable peak load need, the water system source can offer a constant circulation of water. Throughout hours of low demand, the water circulation can be used to fill up storage tanks, towers and tanks, which then provide water for emergency use and periods when need goes beyond the standard pumping rate. A supply of water source can take numerous forms, including groundwater extraction well fields, free-flowing rivers, natural or manufactured ponds, artesian springs, ocean water desalination plants, and rainwater run-off collection systems.</p>
<p>If you have your water evaluated, the report will utilize one or both of these systems to tell you how hard your water is. Since the level of calcium carbonate means little to water consumers, water experts have classified levels of firmness. Table 1 shows these classifications.

<p>The normal option is to have the defective pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is a choice to consider if you reside in an older house - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for numerous years, however steel ultimately suffers from rust and lacks the toughness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
