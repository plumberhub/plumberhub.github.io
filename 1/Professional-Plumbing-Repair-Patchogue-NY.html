<p>Leak detection is a component of water preservation that depends on highly technical knowledge and specialized devices to determine the place of leaks throughout the city's water distribution system and identify the place of those leaks at which visible water may or might not have appeared. Water temperature concerns can be repaired by adjusting the temperature level on the hot water heater. Low water pressure from a sink faucet may be triggered by a blocked aerator screen. House owners can merely loosen the aerator screen from the faucet to clear out minerals or other deposits. If the shutoff valves under the sink are not open all the way, water pressure can also be low.</p>
