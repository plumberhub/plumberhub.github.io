Water pressure might be or stop working minimized when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is an unexpectedly high demand on the water system (for example, when several fire hydrants are opened).

<h3>The Benefits of Using Professional Drainage Services in Littleton CO 80123</h3>
<p>Thank you so much for taking the effort to repair our water softener. over the holidays. We had been on getaway during the time of repair and it was soothing to know it had been taken care of and ready to go upon our return. For a plumber focusing on drain-clearing services, expect to pay at least $70 per hour for drain lines and $125 per hour for sewer lines. Many problems can be repaired in an hour. For weekend or night calls, add more to the per hour rate.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned up quickly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, releasing from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to get rid of debris such as hard water scale, grease, silt, and sand deposits.</p>
<p>Have used Plumb Crazy on three different occasions, the last involving a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our house. Billy and Hector were our technicians and they were great. They quickly discovered the leak and fixed it without making a huge mess. They, as with each person we have actually come across with Plumb Crazy, were considerate, prompt, and very educated. I would advise Plumb Crazy to anybody needing either little or big job plumbing work.</p>
<p>Broken sewer pipes can be more than just a pricey repair-- they can result in comprehensive and pricey home damage and lead to severe health threats. Sewer line repair is the very first line of defense when a sewer line stops working. If the sewer line can't be repaired, sewer line replacement is the just other choice. Thankfully, Mr. Rooter ® Plumbing is your local source for quality sewer repair and replacement at any time.</p>
