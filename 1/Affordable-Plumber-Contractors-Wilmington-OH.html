You 'd be hard-pressed to discover a homeowner complain about the fact that they have a garbage disposal, and many do not know what to do if they move into a home that does not have one.

<p>In some families, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when looking for a viable option, particularly when easy plunging does not appear to work.

These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life.
