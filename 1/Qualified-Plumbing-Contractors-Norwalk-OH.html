<p>Camera are one of the most valuable tools in the plumbing company. Figure out the size of the pipes in the home and around the house - they will assist to identify the water pressure that you'll have. For water pressure to be adequate, the lines need to be 3/4" to one inch directly from the main water source for the home. The pipes themselves need to be at least a 1/2" in diameter to supply adequate flow.</p>
<p>Drains, drains and waste piping are looked for correct grading to preserve down circulation. The plumbing system is tested for leakages. We check that the product utilized in the plumbing system is authorized by a recognized testing laboratory. We prohibit cross connections in between safe water and water from a doubtful source and forbid the discharge of hazardous waste to the sewer system. We also check the vent pipes to stabilize the pressure in the plumbing system.</p>
