Take your brand-new journey lever, place it in the hole where your old journey lever was and secure it. Bear in mind that since of the way a lever works, the locknuts for a lot of toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the proper way. When you've secured the journey lever and are prepared to link your flapper, make certain you've got just enough slack in the chain to ensure the flapper is sealing tightly over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the way when you lower on the journey lever.</p>
