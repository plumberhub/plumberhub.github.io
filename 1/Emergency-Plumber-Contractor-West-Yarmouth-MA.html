<p>Loose flanges are usually the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends on the extent of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>

These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a blockage, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life.
