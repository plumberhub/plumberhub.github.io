<h3>Fixing A Clogged Toilet in Auburn WA 98092</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Deal" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written estimate to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, considering that I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned up from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) and that was just 9 months earlier. I feel that rates were increased because I had a "Offer". An Angie's list article from March stated depending upon the market and seriousness of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Pity on me for not bringing my previous invoice to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>
<p>Pointer: Both anti-siphon valves and pressure vacuum breakers can not avoid back-pressure. I just recently had several plumbing leakages repaired and could not be happier with the prompt service I received from Parker and Sons. They are very educated, friendly, fairly priced, and do quality work. I would absolutely advise them to my household and everybody. I would trust them to repair any leak in the house.</p>
