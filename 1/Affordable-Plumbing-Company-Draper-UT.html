<p>Making use of different metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic deterioration Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever two various types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is created because of the procedure. When galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe, a typical example of this is. It is also worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
