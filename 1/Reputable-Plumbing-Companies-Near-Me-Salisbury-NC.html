Your homes plumbing goes beyond simply the pipes inside your house to the main sewer line that links to them.

Harmed sewer lines can lead to bathrooms flooded with sewage, broken pipes, and pricey repairs.</p>

<p>The simplest method to keep you and your family safe from the possible risks of backflow through cross connections is to not produce cross connections in the first location. However, if you do have a cross connection to a lawn sprinkler system, boiler, pool, water feature or other kind of cross connection, have an approved backflow prevention assembly set up.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned up rapidly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, producing from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to eliminate debris such as tough water scale, sand, grease, and silt deposits.</p>

Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for numerous decades, but steel ultimately suffers from deterioration and lacks the toughness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
