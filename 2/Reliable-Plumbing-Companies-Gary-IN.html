<p>In the very first half of the twentieth century, a variety of products were utilized for house plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most typical metals, while clay was utilized for sewer line piping. Although all these products are resilient in the short-term, they deteriorate over years. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are prone to various types of rust. After about fifty years, they'll begin to deteriorate from rust and might position toxins into the freshwater supply. We suggest changing the iron, clay, and steel pipes in your house. This might not require completely repiping your house, given that more recent materials might have currently been used in some areas, such as the bathroom plumbing.
