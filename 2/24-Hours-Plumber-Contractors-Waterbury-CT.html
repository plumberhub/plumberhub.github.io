<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Spotty meals? Some underground rain gutter drains terminate in the sewer system instead of at the edge of your yard. In that case, step from the downspout to the nearby manhole, and utilize an auger line at least that long to ensure you're cleaning the whole pipe. A garbage disposal will last 10 to 12-years, and most guarantees cover the very first 2 to 5-years. When purchasing a brand-new unit, keep this in mind.</p>
