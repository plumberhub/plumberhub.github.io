<p>The normal solution is to have the faulty pipes changed when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping is available in.

Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for lots of decades, however steel ultimately suffers from corrosion and lacks the toughness these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
