<p>The key to the technology is having the ability to control both the crystal development rate and their removal from our polymer beads, consequently eliminating firmness ions and producing a water softening benefit that does not need replacement chemicals or regrowth of active sites," stated Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and chief technology officer. This technology is more cost efficient and lasts longer than typical water softening items such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>

<p>The normal solution is to have the faulty pipes changed when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping is available in.

Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for lots of decades, however steel ultimately suffers from corrosion and lacks the toughness these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
