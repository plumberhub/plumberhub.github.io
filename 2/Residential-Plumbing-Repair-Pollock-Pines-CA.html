<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak.

As quickly as he left, my tenants tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not return due to the fact that he had another appointment.
