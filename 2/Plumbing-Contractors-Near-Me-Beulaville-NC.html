<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. But the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is widely thought of. If you have moderately tough water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday sodium intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of salt included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
