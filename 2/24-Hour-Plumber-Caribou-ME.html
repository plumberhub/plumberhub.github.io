Your home is over ten years old, and you have never had the sewer and drain lines inspected. Some plumbers may get professional discount rates from sellers or kitchen and bath display rooms. If you need a new sink or faucet, compare their costs with what you can discover online or at home enhancement stores. They might be getting you a better deal</p>
