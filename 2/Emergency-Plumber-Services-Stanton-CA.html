<p>A toilet auger works the opposite way that a plunger does. Rather than removing the clog with unfavorable pressure, it actually pushes into the obstruction, working further into where the blockage is taking place. The auger or snake" is then utilized to press the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear course for water to flow easily. The auger's corkscrew-shaped pointer assists force it even more down into the clog, making it simpler to clear.</p>
