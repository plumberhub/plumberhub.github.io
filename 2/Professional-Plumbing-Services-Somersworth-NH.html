<p>The simplest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc attached to an atmospheric vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outside air. This activates the disc to open, permitting air to get in the valve and restore pressure comparable to ambient atmospheric standard. This repair of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
