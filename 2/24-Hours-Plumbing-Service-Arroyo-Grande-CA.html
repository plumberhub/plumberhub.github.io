Backflow prevention gadgets operate by allowing water to flow in only one direction. In an unguarded water service connection, drinkable water can flow both in and out of a building or fixture. When water service is disrupted in the street or in a building for any reason, there is a pressure drop which can draw contaminated water in reverse into the water system. For example, cleaning fluids may be drawn back from car cleans; stagnant water from fire sprinkler systems may go into the drinking waterline; germs and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water system from a/c cooling towers; and chemicals from medical clinic's X-ray development may flow in reverse into the potable water system.
