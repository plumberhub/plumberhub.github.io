<p>Regardless of whether it is an electrical hot water heater or a gas hot water heater, Premier Plumbing has actually offered hot water heater repair and installation service in the Hampton Roadways area since 1978. From under the sink, slide the fiber gasket, backup flange and mounting flange over the sink flange. Hold these pieces in place. The inspector will ensure that the work is being performed in accordance with the applicable codes and requirements.

<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. However the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is commonly imagined. If you have moderately difficult water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday sodium consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of sodium included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
