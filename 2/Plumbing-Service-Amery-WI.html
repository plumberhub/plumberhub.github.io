<p>Water firmness is the quantity of liquified calcium and magnesium in the water-- difficult water is high in both calcium and magnesium. The reason you can feel the difference on your skin is since soap reacts with the calcium to form soap residue. This results in the need for more soap or detergent to get things clean. Which's where the term firmness" originated from ... it's difficult to wash in.</p>
<p>As soon as you've found the journey lever you desire, all you truly need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) remove your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your brand-new journey lever, location it in the hole where your old journey lever was and protect it. Bear in mind that since of the way a lever works, the locknuts for a lot of toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the right method. When you've secured the journey lever and are all set to link your flapper, make sure you have actually got simply enough slack in the chain to guarantee the flapper is sealing tightly over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the way when you push down on the trip lever.</p>
<p>Tough water is caused by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners treat the water by using salt and ion-exchange resins to eliminate these minerals. When the water can be found in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions transfer out of the water and onto the active sites on the resin. Then they are changed in the option by the sodium ions.</p>
