<p>Hellenbrand water softeners and conditioners get rid of calcium and magnesium from your water, leaving it softer and cleaner. Put simply, soft water saves you money. Lowered Pressure Backflow Prevention Assembly (RP): An RP is a mechanical backflow preventer that includes two individually acting, spring-loaded check valves with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, spring-loaded pressure differential relief valve between the check valves and listed below the very first check valve.</p>
<p>Responsive flow technology works by continuously bringing tanks off-line and on-line in action to the water demands of your carwash. For instance, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive flow technology, just one of the four tanks is required to soften water when the carwash isn't hectic. Nevertheless, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill up. This responsive design permits the MTS to consume to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than conventional single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
