<p>When compared to gas models, electrical models are easier and less expensive to install as electricity is currently readily available through the main power supply line. For gas water heaters, a particular gas line has to be installed and a practical source of gas established. Another feature of an electrical water heater is that they do not require any ventilation. Gas models need to be ventilated effectively using vents and ducts in order to function properly. With electrical models, you will not have to install any brand-new vents or ducts in your house.</p>
