<p>Individuals who write these articles should be thoughtful of the customer and the professional service provider.

As soon as the FutureSoft water softener is installed, you will not have a slippery feel to the water as you would have with a salt-based water softener. This does not mean it's not working.

<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal solution is to have the defective pipes changed. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is an option to think about if you reside in an older house - such as one built pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for many decades, but steel ultimately struggles with deterioration and does not have the resilience these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
