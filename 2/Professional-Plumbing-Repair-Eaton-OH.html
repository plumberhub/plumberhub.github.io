Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is created because of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is likewise worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
