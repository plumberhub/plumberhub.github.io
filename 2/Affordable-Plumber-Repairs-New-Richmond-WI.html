<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of a lot of repairs, there are lots of other small toilet parts that need to likewise be well preserved to help prevent leakages and other toilet difficulties.

We strongly recommend also changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything is in tip-top shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
