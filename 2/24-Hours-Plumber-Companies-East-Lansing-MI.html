<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound drinkable supply of water. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
