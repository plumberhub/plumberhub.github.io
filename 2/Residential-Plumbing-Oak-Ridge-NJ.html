Take your brand-new journey lever, location it in the hole where your old journey lever was and protect it. Remember that due to the fact that of the way a lever works, the locknuts for the majority of toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so be sure you're turning things the proper way. When you've secured the trip lever and are prepared to connect your flapper, make sure you've got just enough slack in the chain to guarantee the flapper is sealing tightly over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the way when you lower on the journey lever.</p>
