<p>Backflow preventers are also required by the plumbing code. Other than within Coastline, the plumbing authority for Seattle Public Utilities customers is King County plumbing (Public Health - Seattle & King County). The City of Coastline is the plumbing authority within Coastline's city limits. Seattle Public Utilities works with both King County plumbing and the City of Shoreline when it pertains to backflow preventer requirements.</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions likewise permit options to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems supplying devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the supply of water. This removes the need for a backflow preventer, since every time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
<p>Homeowners can practice preventive maintenance to prevent future drainage concerns. As soon as a. month, use a plunger in your shower and tub drains to remove any stuck-on debris. Pour warm water with liquid soap down the drain, grind some ice and table salt in the garbage disposal to eliminate grease. Another good technique is using a drain strainer to keep out hair and soap residue from getting in your pipes.</p>

<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a natural or artificial, sand-like product covered with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water streams through the system while the resin launches its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
