<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in San Marcos TX 78666?</h3>
<p>When compared to gas models, electric designs are simpler and more economical to install as electrical power is currently offered through the main power supply line. For gas hot water heater, a particular gas line has to be installed and a viable source of gas developed. Another function of an electrical hot water heater is that they do not need any ventilation. Gas models need to be aerated effectively using vents and ducts in order to work correctly. With electric models, you will not have to install any new vents or ducts in your house.</p>
<p>Caution: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on a lot of rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts down. This is because the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system. The likelihood of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or at least minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however for the most part it must be much less water.</p>
