Avoid flex pipe that can be bent into any configuration, in addition to flexible rubber traps. Debris can quickly capture in this type of piping while the piping's flexible nature does not offer needed assistance for the drain basket. PVC assemblies are an excellent option s they can be easily connected to metal drain pipes. Seal connections with silicone and ensure it sets prior to testing the drain.</p>
<p>The anode rod in your hot water heater is developed to draw in corrosion-causing elements in the water, helping to avoid the steel tank from rusting.
