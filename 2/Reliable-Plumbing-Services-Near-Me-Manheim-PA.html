Continuous feed disposals are simple to run: you run water in the kitchen sink, flip a switch, and feed the disposal with food scraps and compostable waste. With this kind of waste disposal unit, however, bottle caps, flatware, and other metal particles can often get caught in the blades. This can harm the blades and need repairs.</p>

It is a relatively simple device that draws food scraps down into a barbed mill ring that rotates at high speeds, which crushes the scraps. They pass through to the rest of the wastewater to be disposed of when they are small enough. If you have a battle drain setup, it normally takes up your kitchen sink drain but can be set up on just one side.</p>
