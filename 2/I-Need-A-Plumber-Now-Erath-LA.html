Prevent flex pipe that can be bent into any configuration, in addition to flexible rubber traps. Debris can quickly capture in this type of piping while the piping's flexible nature does not offer required assistance for the drain basket. PVC assemblies are an excellent choice s they can be easily attached to metal drain pipes. Seal connections with silicone and make sure it sets prior to testing the drain.</p>
<p>To connect a power cable to the new system, eliminate the electrical cover plate on the bottom of the disposer and sign up with the colored wires discovered inside with their counterparts in the cord, using wire nuts. The green ground wire is looped under the green screw on the unit. This can be done at any point prior to installation.
