PVC assemblies are an excellent choice s they can be easily attached to metal drain pipes. Seal connections with silicone and make sure it sets prior to testing the drain.</p>
<p>To connect a power cable to the new system, eliminate the electrical cover plate on the bottom of the disposer and sign up with the colored wires discovered inside with their counterparts in the cord, using wire nuts.
