<p>Water heaters can be a pricey investment for homeowners that they cope with for over a decade.

Plumbers typically charge $45 to $65 an hour and can generally install a water heater in a day or in 6-8 hours.</p>
<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Photo 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on specific new sinks, however these will be identified to that impact. Use a non-water-based silicone if you can't use plumber's putty. When you tighten the locknut in location, excess putty will squeeze out in between the new basket strainer and the sink. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel.

If not-- or if there is no disposal currently in place-- start by removing the old drain. A lot of drains are connected to the sink by a large nut below the sink that can be turned counter-clockwise to loosen.</p>
