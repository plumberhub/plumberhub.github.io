<p>Please let EBMUD understand of any scenario that might require a backflow device. In some cases conditions on residential or commercial properties change that may require a backflow device, such as treating a boiler with additives or setting up a well with a pump. Sewer repairs are more than a trouble for your service, they can cause financial losses and in some instances can stop your service entirely. For dining establishments having a drain back up or a sewer line break can be disastrous. Even in a small office the issues brought on by even little drain problems can trigger major problems.</p>
