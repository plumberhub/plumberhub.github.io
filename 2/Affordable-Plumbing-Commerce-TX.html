<p>The key to the innovation is having the ability to manage both the crystal development rate and their removal from our polymer beads, consequently removing hardness ions and producing a water softening advantage that does not require replacement chemicals or regeneration of active websites," specified Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and chief innovation officer. This technology is more cost reliable and lasts longer than common water softening items such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>

An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or link a new pipe. This makes building and construction projects quickly the most typical reason for backflow problems. Fire combating is another typical cause of backflow. Fire trucks utilize huge pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This often causes the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will take place in the surrounding communities.</p>
