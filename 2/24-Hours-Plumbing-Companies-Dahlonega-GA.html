<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Sick Of False Promises? Bad Smells - If nasty odors are emerging from your drain, this is a clear indication your sink is not effectively draining pipes water. Undesirable stinks are a direct result of waste-build up in your drain piping. When this build-up collects, it can result in more powerful smells, and more serious piping issues. Without functional draining, extreme pressure can cause your piping system to break and leak resulting in pricey water damage.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Reduced Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is minimized by the # 1 Inspect spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure difference across the # 1 check valve preserves the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>
