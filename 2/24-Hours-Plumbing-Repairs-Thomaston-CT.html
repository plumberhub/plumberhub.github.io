<p>Pull the two lines out of the trimmer, one at a time. Dispose of the harmed fuel lines. A small round fuel line filter will pop off the thin line leading into the tank when you pull the fuel lines from the trimmer. Lay it aside so you can reattach it to the new line throughout installation. Fewer parts in the system result in less tankless water heater repair visits.</p>

Also, hybrids need up to 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to catch sufficient heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to discharge the condensate.</p>
