<p>If there are any lead pipes in the home, discover out. Homes that were developed prior to 1986 typically have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you understand, no matter how useful, is an environmental toxic substance (note the need for unleaded fuel and paint in homes that is not lead based). You may not want to live in a house that has lead pipes if you have children.</p>
<p>If you turn on your home's water spigots and water begins flowing out with a yellowish, reddish or brownish tint, that's a clear indication that rust or sediment has built up in your pipes and a repiping task should remain in your future.
