<p>Loose flanges are usually the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws just will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends upon the extent of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
