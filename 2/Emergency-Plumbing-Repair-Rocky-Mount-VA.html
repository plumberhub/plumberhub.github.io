In these programs, older 3.5 and 6.0 - gallons per flush toilet components in houses were replaced with 1.6 - gallons per flush models. Constant clogs: If the plunger has actually ended up being a regular fixture in your bathroom, it's time for a replacement. Constant obstructions show your toilet no longer has the power required to successfully remove waste with each flush.</p>
