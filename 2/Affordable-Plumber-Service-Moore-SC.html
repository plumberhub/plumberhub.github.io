<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite reasonable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
<p>Whether you need waste disposal unit repair or installation, Maeser can help. A garbage disposal is an essential kitchen appliance in a lot of houses today. While the majority of kitchen sink disposers can deal with almost any type of food waste, they are not indestructible. When a fork, bone or other things jams the impeller or shredding ring, the disposal will stop running. Used impellers on older disposals can become inadequate, increasing the danger of drain blockages.</p>
