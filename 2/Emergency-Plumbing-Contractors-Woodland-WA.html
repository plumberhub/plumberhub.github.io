Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather affordable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs.

<h3>Hiring The Services Of A Professional Plumbing Service Provider Woodland WA</h3>
<p>A. Normally wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undetected issue. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
