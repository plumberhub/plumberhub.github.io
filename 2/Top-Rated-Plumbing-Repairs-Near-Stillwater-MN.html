<p>Leaky faucets and clogged drains are the most common sink repair problems. Common enough that many people opt for diy repairs. But in some cases even determining the leak can be an issue. It might be the shutoff valve, the faucet, a spray hose, waste disposal unit fittings, the edge of the sink itself, or any part of the drain-- tailpiece, extension tube, slip extension, elbows, T joints, or the U or J trap.</p>
<p>Difficult water is brought on by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners deal with the water by utilizing salt and ion-exchange resins to remove these minerals. When the water can be found in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions move out of the water and onto the active sites on the resin. Then they are replaced in the option by the sodium ions.</p>
<p>If you don't have a plumber's snake, you can use a wire coat hanger by aligning it. Naturally, it will not reach as far as a plumber's snake would, however it might be long enough to reach some blockages. Place it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to press through or take out the clog if you can reach it. Take care not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
