Kenny came out and did an extraordinary task unclogging my storm drain. He identified the issue and had the ability to return and jet it out.

<p>Replacing your flapper might require a little different actions than we show (Images 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Finding a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the task if you have an uncommon flush valve. To discover an appropriate replacement, switch off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware store. (Turn off the water before removing the flapper.) You may not discover an identical match, however opportunities are you'll locate among the exact same shape and diameter. If not, attempt a plumbing supply store (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>
