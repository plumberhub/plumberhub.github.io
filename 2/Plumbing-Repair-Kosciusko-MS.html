<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when looking for a feasible service, specifically when basic plunging doesn't appear to work. Nevertheless, there are lots of downsides to using these dangerous items - not least of which is that they normally consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a blockage, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of presenting the threat of harm to your home and family.</p>
