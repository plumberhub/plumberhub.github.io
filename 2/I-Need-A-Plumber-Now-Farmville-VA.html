For this reason, WQA suggests that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not cause this kind of corrosion A softener is merely catching some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations while doing so (usually sodium or sometimes potassium).</p>
