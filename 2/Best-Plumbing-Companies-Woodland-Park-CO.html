<p>Determining if you need a water softener is a personal choice. The water quality improvement market has actually earnestly looked for to figure out the accurate details on water softener system effluent. A recent septic system research study from the Water Quality Association plainly indicates that there are no negative impacts when water softening waste water is released into appropriately installed personal septic tanks. There are several additional reports that also describe more proof of the hardness ions in a softener's regeneration waste causing less obstructing and preserving greater permeability than the routine septic system effluent.</p>

In the bigger backflow prevention assemblies (2 - 10") the iron bodies will be covered to minimize any scale development or corrosion.

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers which might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no further repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. Because he had another appointment, they called him back and he said he would not come back. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
