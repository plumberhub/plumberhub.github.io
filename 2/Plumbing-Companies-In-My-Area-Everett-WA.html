<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Everett WA</h3>
<p>A camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it avoids the need to collect your yard. During a video camera inspection, a sewer and drain technician runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from bathtubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Utilizing the images caught by the camera, we can determine any sewer and drain line problems, such as clogs, tree root intrusion, misaligned joints, cracks, and other damage.</p>
