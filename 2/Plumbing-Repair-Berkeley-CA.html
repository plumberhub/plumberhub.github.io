<p>If you see a smell or undesirable smell coming from your system, which is not uncommon, consider buying a flange that can seal up and cover the top of the disposal, where nasty smells can escape. These flanges are commonly readily available and easy to install, costing around $30 in your home enhancement or hardware stores. Turn off the water supply to your home at the main line. To avoid leaks from springing throughout the installation procedure, turned off the supply of water to your house. Make sure your hot water heater's water system is turned off, as is the electrical power going to the system.</p>
