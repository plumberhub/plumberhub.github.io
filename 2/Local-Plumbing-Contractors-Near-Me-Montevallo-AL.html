This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been eliminated-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA recommends that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not cause this type of rust A softener is merely capturing some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations in the process (normally salt or often potassium).</p>
