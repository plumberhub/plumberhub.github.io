<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Innovation (HVLD) testing procedure consists of a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made of a non-conductive product. Some softeners work on electricity, however some more recent water softeners utilize waterpower. Costs of a water softener significantly depend upon the kind of water softener and the type of energy that is used, but likewise upon the solidity of the water that requires softening and the water use.
