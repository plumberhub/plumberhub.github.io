<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach maximum capability and can't bring in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank need to be regenerated, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank can be found in. An on-board computer calculates the quantity of water that streams through the softener. Regrowth immediately starts when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom home and household of 4, regeneration usually occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
<p>Plainly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange website. When all the sodium exchange sites are replaced with solidity minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. When backwashing is total, the softener can be returned to use. Some water softeners will instantly change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
