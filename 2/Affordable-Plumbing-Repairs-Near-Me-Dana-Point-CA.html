<h3>Quality Plumbing Services In Dana Point CA</h3>
<p>In the 1990 â€² s, dry spell conditions determined water companies to execute water preservation programs in California. In these programs, older 3.5 and 6.0 - gallons per flush toilet fixtures in residences were changed with 1.6 - gallons per flush models. Constant clogs: If the plunger has actually become a regular fixture in your bathroom, it's time for a replacement. Continuous blockages show your toilet no longer has the power required to successfully get rid of waste with each flush.</p>
<p>Changing your flapper might need slightly different steps than we show (Photos 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Discovering a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the job if you have an unusual flush valve. To discover a suitable replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware store. (Turn off the water before eliminating the flapper.) You may not discover an identical match, but possibilities are you'll locate one of the same shape and diameter. If not, try a plumbing supply shop (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>
