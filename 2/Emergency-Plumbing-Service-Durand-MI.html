We now have cleaned and examined the parts, replaced the rubber repair parts, re-assembled the parts and the rubber parts back into their components, cleaned up the body and the seats and flushed the inbound water line. We are now prepared to start the re-assembly procedure. Some models require the elements to be removed in a specific order. These assemblies will also need the re-assembly in a particular order. Numerous components can not be re-installed into the body unless the test dicks are exposed. As each part is put back into the body, it is very important to put them back in the right place. It is also crucial that as they are put back into the body, that no foreign matter is connected on the components or unintentionally put in the body. The elements need to be placed so that the guides are able to preserve their created tolerances.</p>
