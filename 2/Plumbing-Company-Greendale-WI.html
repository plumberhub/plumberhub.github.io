<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and examined and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some components might have very tight tolerances that need to be kept. An essential thing to identify on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the part.

If the element is not fixed appropriately, the guide might limit the movement (instead of consistent or direct) of the element, which could trigger the component to not work to its abilities. Many times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are restricting the travel of the element triggering lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
