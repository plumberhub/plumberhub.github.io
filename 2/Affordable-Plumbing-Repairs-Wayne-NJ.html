<p>Concealed water leaks are typically stressful and have Possibly Serious Repercussions. When it rains, any excess water is expected to go down a storm drain in order to prevent flooding problems. If you are presently experiencing any flooding on your home when it rains, then there is a great chance that the storm drain is clogged and therefore needs to be cleaned out. If a clogged storm drain is not addressed in a timely manner, the possibilities are high that it will trigger extra damage to the storm pipe, which will require repair.</p>
<p>The anode rod in your hot water heater is designed to attract corrosion-causing components in the water, helping to prevent the steel tank from corroding. The best way to prevent drain obstructions is to see what you flush. If you look at your house's plumbing pipes and see spots, staining, flaking, little imprints or rust, your pipes are corroding. Wearing away pipes are most likely to spring a leak (if they haven't already) and ought to be replaced as soon as possible.</p>
