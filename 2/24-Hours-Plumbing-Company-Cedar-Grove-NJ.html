<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. Over time, the deposits collect, until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits take place more frequently when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. You might have your drain pipes expertly cleaned if you desire to make twice as sure your toilet is the issue prior to you replace it. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks, it's time for a new one.</p>
