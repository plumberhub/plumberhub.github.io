After all, isn't all water soft? Fair point. However water softeners were produced to fight a remarkably common problem: hard water.</p>
<p>A garbage disposal lasts an average of 10 to 12 years. This typical life expectancy computation presumes typical wear and tear of the system. The life-span of a garbage disposal might be lower in the case of disregard, overuse, and abuse of the disposal unit. Time for a new bathroom or kitchen sink installation?

<p>Chelation: Another approach is to present a chemical compound that serves as a chelating representative. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and remain suspended in the water rather than developing on surfaces. Nevertheless, if they stay in one location for long, as they may in a water heater, the buildup could still take place.</p>
