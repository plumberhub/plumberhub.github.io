Decreased Pressure Backflow Prevention Assembly (RP): An RP is a mechanical backflow preventer that consists of 2 separately acting, spring-loaded check valves with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, spring-loaded pressure differential relief valve in between the check valves and below the first check valve.</p>
<p>DCVs are particularly designed to avoid backflow in fire sprinkler systems. The mainstay for regular fire security applications, DCVs include an inlet (upstream) shutoff valve, two individually operating spring-loaded check valves (normally inside a single valve body), 4 test dicks, and an outlet (downstream) shutoff valve.
