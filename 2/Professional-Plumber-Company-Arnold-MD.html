Utilizing the images caught by the camera, we can pinpoint any sewer and drain line problems, such as obstructions, tree root invasion, misaligned joints, cracks, and other damage.</p>

At Premier Plumbing we help you make the ideal decision based your needs so you understand that the hot water heater you purchase is the right one for your house or business at the lowest cost possible. Clogged Toilet: For toilets that are terribly clogged, we will snake the drain to remove it at last.</p>
<p>Our blocked drain Los Angeles solutions are customized to your specific problem. Whether the clog is in the kitchen sink, bathroom sink, or shower drains, we can clear it. The area of the drain is essential because it helps our plumbers to know the kind of clog they might be dealing with. Shower drains normally get hair clogs, and kitchen sink drains are prone to grease clogs.</p>
<p>If you do not have a plumber's snake, you can use a wire coat hanger by aligning it. Of course, it will not reach as far as a plumber's snake would, but it might be long enough to reach some blockages. Insert it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to push through or pull out the clog if you can reach it. Take care not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
