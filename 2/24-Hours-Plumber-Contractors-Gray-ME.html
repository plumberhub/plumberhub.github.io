<h3>Why You Need Trustworthy Plumbing Services Gray ME</h3>
<p>A. Normally wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected problem. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>The connections of kitchen sink faucets are another typical leak-prone area. These can likewise be tough to repair as they are usually located behind the sink, in confined areas. The very best way to tighten them is with a pair of locking pliers. Wrenches use up excessive space and need a broad swing angle, which might be hard to get in little areas.</p>
