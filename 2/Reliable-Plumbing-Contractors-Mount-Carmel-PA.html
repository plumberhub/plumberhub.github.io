<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your service' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation need, tanks come online to include flow rate capability. During periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's arguably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
