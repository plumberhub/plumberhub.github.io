<h3>Ensure Your Kitchen Sink Stays Unclogged With Three Easy Steps in Owosso MI 48867</h3>

For this factor, WQA recommends that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not cause this type of deterioration A softener is just catching some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (generally sodium or in some cases potassium).</p>
