<p>Light Blue = Lowered Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is reduced by the # 1 Examine spring (for instance, to 90 psi).

<p>The easiest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc attached to an atmospheric vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop listed below that of the outdoors air. This sets off the disc to open, allowing air to enter the valve and bring back pressure comparable to ambient atmospheric standard. This remediation of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
