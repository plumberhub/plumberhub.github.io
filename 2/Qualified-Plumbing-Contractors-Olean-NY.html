<p>Provided there isn't a tank failure, typically a commercial water heater can be repaired, but is it worth repairing? Only after addressing the following concerns must you respond to repair or replace. Do you know the number of years old your water heater is? Do you know the number of years it's rated for? If it is close to the number of years the water heater was ranked for, think about replacement rather of repair.</p>

<p>Lastly, the most sophisticated and complex backflow preventer is the lowered pressure zone device. This device includes no less than 5 separately operating valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other 4. Throughout standard water streams at design pressure, the 2 check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage occurs to the linked service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a advanced and reliable  (if pricey) device is best utilized in important areas where cross contamination might be a direct danger to life and health.</p>
