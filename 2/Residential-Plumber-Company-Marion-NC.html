<h3>Ensure Your Kitchen Sink Stays Unclogged With Three Easy Steps in Marion NC 28752</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your service' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capacity. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's arguably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
