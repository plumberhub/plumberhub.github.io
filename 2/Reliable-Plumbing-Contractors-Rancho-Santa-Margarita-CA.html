The very best method to prevent drain clogs is to watch what you flush.

Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in sodium is small, but if you've been encouraged by a doctor to follow a rigorous low salt diet this boost can pose problems.</p>
