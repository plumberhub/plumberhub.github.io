<p>Reverse osmosis utilizes an applied pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to conquer osmotic pressure and remove water molecules from the solution with solidity ions. The membrane has pores big enough to confess water particles for passage; solidity ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water supply is without solidity ions with no other ions being included. Membranes are a kind of water filter requiring routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
