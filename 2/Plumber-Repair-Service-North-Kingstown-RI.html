The majority of the Valley in truth has some of the worst water in the nation. We rank 3rd for the outright worst water in the nation according to DailyFinance and the Environmental Working Group. Having bad water comes naturally, we do reside in a desert after all. In fact the water you shower with, brush your teeth, and even drink has a chlorine level that is perfect for swimming pools. We have 300% more chemicals that go beyond nationwide health guidelines, and a even high percentage of contaminants in our water that the national average. On top of that our average water hardness level is between 18-23 grains per gallon of water or for simplicity factors "very difficult water".</p>
<p>In order to avoid your drains from getting clogged in the future, pay close attention to what is being cleaned down your system. Hair loss when taking a shower is a basic issue when it comes to clogged drains in the bathroom, and pieces of food and grease are a common issue in the kitchen. When it comes to avoiding beverage clogs and is for that reason highly suggested, putting a catcher in all household drains will be extremely helpful.</p>
