Fair point. But water softeners were produced to combat a remarkably typical issue: tough water.</p>
<p>Our licensed plumbing service technicians can do this for you, or you can do it yourself by connecting a hose to drain the tank to an ideal drain. Flushing the water heating tank need to be done 2x every year.

<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from typical flow direction within a piping system that is triggered by negative pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the turnaround of typical flow in a system triggered by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water supply piping). Back-siphonage can happen when there is a high velocity in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is reduced main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as during fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>
