<p>As the pipes continue to age, flakes of rust will build up in various parts of the plumbing system, the majority of frequently in shower heads, faucets, and shut-off valves. This can cause low flow issues or perhaps stop a fixture from streaming entirely. The next typical issue that occurs with older galvanized pipes is the arterial sclerosis" of the system, which occurs when the swelling of the pipes gets to be so severe that it lowers the readily available volume of water that can flow around the system.</p>
<p>Warning: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on many rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off. Due to the fact that the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water system, this is. The possibility of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or a minimum of minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, nevertheless in most cases it must be much less water.</p>
