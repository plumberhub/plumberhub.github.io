<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements might have very tight tolerances that need to be kept. An important thing to identify on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the component. The guide is a really important part of the design of each component. If the component is not repaired properly, the guide might limit the movement (instead of direct or steady) of the part, which could cause the component to not work to its abilities. Lot of times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the element causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
