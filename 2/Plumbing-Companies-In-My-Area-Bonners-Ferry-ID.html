<p>The LAGBC is based upon the 2013 California Green Building Standards Code, commonly referred to as "CALGreen" that was developed and mandated by the State to attain consistency amongst the numerous jurisdictions within the State; decrease the building's energy and water use; lower waste; and lower the carbon footprint. Continuous feed disposals are easy to run: you run water in the kitchen sink, flip a switch, and feed the disposal with food scraps and compostable waste. With this type of waste disposal unit, however, bottle caps, silverware, and other metal particles can in some cases get caught in the blades. This can damage the blades and need repairs.</p>

Commercial sinks handle more water and have a more efficient straining system to keep food and other particles out of the plumbing system. In fact, commercial sink drains have more parts than residential sink drains. If your commercial sinks have a clogged drain, call the experts at Roto-Rooter. We provide a full series of commercial drain services to help you keep your establishment running smoothly. We provide sink repair, toilet repair, shower repair and can even fix floor drains.</p>

There are hydraulic conditions such as pressure variations and disc compression that could cause incorrect data on the functions of the backflow prevention assembly. Hydraulic conditions such as water hammer can result in extreme pressure spikes that could damage components. The impacts of elevated temperature level can also trigger extreme pressure conditions which might damage the parts in the parts. These and other unfavorable impacts from the hydraulic conditions need to be recognized and their cause corrected. If parts are changed and the hydraulic conditions are not remedied, the brand-new parts can soon be made inoperative.</p>
