<h3>The Different Kinds Of Plumbers Kennebunk ME</h3>
<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
