<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems.

During periods of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capacity. Throughout periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line.
