<p>Loose flanges are generally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends on the extent of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
