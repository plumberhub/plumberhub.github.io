<p>Camera are one of the most important tools in the plumbing service. Determine the size of the pipes in the home and around the house - they will assist to figure out the water pressure that you'll have. For water pressure to be adequate, the lines ought to be 3/4" to one inch directly from the main water source for the home. The pipes themselves need to be at least a 1/2" in diameter to provide adequate flow.</p>
<p>Our licensed plumbing service technicians can do this for you, or you can do it yourself by attaching a hose to drain the tank to an ideal drain. Flushing the water heating tank need to be done 2x every year. So, while a chemical drain cleaner may offer a fast fix in the short term, it can cause even more problems, damage, and headaches in the long run.
