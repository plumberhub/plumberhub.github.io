<p>Leak detection belongs of water conservation that relies on highly technical proficiency and specialized devices to identify the location of leaks throughout the city's water distribution system and determine the place of those leaks at which visible water might or might not have actually appeared. Sick of awaiting your sink to drain after every use? Call Polestar Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning at (913) 432-3342 and let our plumbing contractors aid with expert drain cleaning.

Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Generally, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to start with. Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in salt is small, however if you've been recommended by a doctor to follow a stringent low salt diet this boost can present problems.</p>
