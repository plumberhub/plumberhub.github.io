When your water lines are repiped, it simply implies old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with new pipes. We discover that houses 15 years or older who have never ever had repiping work are the most likely prospects for water line replacement. You might be in need of water line repiping if you have an older home and are experiencing frequent and major leakages. We find that repiping can in fact be the cheaper and better long-term solution if you do have frequent leaks.</p>
<p>Replacing your flapper might need slightly different steps than we show (Pictures 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube.

To find a suitable replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware shop. (Turn off the water prior to eliminating the flapper.) You may not find a similar match, however opportunities are you'll find among the same shape and size. If not, attempt a plumbing supply store (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>
