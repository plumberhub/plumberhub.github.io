<p>Backflow is bad news. After an inspection has actually been set up using the Permits and Inspections Online Permitting Service scheduling system, inspectors may be called in between 8:00 am - 9:00 am the day of the inspection. The inspectors will organize their day-to-day work schedules and do not know what inspections have actually been requested prior to the inspection date.</p>
<p>Next, inspect the body. Depending on the size and maker, the bodies can be made of bronze, plastic, stainless steel, cast iron or ductile iron. It is once again essential for the repair professional to be aware of the solidity of the products so that their cleaning process is not devastating.

It is essential that the repair service technician is delicate to the hardness and type of the different finishings utilized on iron body units so as not to damage the protective coating.</p>
