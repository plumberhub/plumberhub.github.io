Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or decreased pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common kind of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

<p>A toilet auger works the opposite way that a plunger does. Instead of removing the clog with unfavorable pressure, it actually pushes into the blockage, working further into where the blockage is happening.
