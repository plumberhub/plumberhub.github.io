<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers which might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no more repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. Due to the fact that he had another appointment, they called him back and he said he would not come back.
