<h3>Water Heater Repair: When to Do It Yourself, and When to Call the Pros in Mount Morris MI 48458</h3>
<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one should first consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener elements. When these elements are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
