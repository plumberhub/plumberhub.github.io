This is a type of plastic resin that was commonly used by contractors for homes built in the 1970s through the 1990s.

<p>A cross-connection is any permanent or short-term connection between a public water system or consumer's drinkable (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system consisting of nonpotable water or other compounds. An example is the piping in between a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water system and an auxiliary water supply, cooling system or watering system.</p>
<p>A well-designed irrigation system is important for the health of plants in a landscape but it's also crucial for human health. An effective irrigation system keeps the water for landscapes different from drinkable drinking water, avoiding contamination that can cause illnesses. That's why a backflow preventer is a requirement on any irrigation task.</p>
