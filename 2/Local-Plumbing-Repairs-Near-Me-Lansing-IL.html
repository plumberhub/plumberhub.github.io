<h3>Three Ways To Find An Emergency Plumber Near Me Lansing IL</h3>
<p>A video camera inspection takes the uncertainty out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it avoids the need to dig up your lawn. During a video camera inspection, a sewer and drain service technician runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from bathtubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Utilizing the images recorded by the camera, we can identify any sewer and drain line problems, such as obstructions, tree root invasion, misaligned joints, fractures, and other damage.</p>
<p>Check the disposal. Turn the power back on, run water into the sink and turn on the disposal to ensure it works. Check underneath to be sure there aren't any leaks. Run some food through the disposal to be sure it grinds and gets disposed of correctly. Pipes made from galvanized steel are no longer used in new houses, but numerous houses developed in between the 1930s - 1980s still have them. Galvanized steel pipes need to be removed by a professional plumber when found and replaced with another pipe material.</p>
