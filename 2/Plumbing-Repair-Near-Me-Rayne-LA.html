A PVB is a mechanical backflow prevention assembly that includes an individually acting, spring-loaded check valve and an independently acting, spring-loaded, air inlet valve on the discharge side of the check valve. It consists of shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is geared up with test cocks. A PVB may be utilized to separate health or non-health hazards but is effective against back-siphonage only.</p>
<p>In truth, reverse circulation testing created to ensure that backflow preventers avoid backflow was gotten rid of from NFPA 25 in 2011.
