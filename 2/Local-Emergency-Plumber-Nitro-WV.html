<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits accumulate, till they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes. These deposits occur more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe.
