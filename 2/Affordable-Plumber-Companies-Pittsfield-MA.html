<h3>The Importance Of Commercial Plumbing Services Pittsfield MA</h3>
<p>Get rid of electrical cover plate and separate the disposal from the electrical connections. Rock salt contains a great deal of matter that is not water-soluble.

<h3>Five Things To Do Today To Avoid A Clogged Toilet in Pittsfield MA 01201</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Offer" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written price quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, considering that I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned up from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) which was only 9 months earlier. I feel that prices were increased because I had a "Offer". An Angie's list post from March stated depending on the marketplace and severity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my past invoice to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
