<p>Loose flanges are generally the result of wood rot. The flange screws merely will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends upon the degree of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>

I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite reasonable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>

When galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
