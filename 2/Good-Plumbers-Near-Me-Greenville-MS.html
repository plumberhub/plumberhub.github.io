<p>Though water line replacement sounds like your home's equivalent of significant surgery, it's really something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with often. When your water lines are repiped, it simply indicates old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with new pipes. We find that homes 15 years or older who have never ever had repiping work are the most likely prospects for water line replacement.

We discover that repiping can actually be the cheaper and better long-term service if you do have regular leakages.</p>
<p>Changing your flapper may require slightly different actions than we show (Photos 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an unusual flush valve, finding a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the task. To find an ideal replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware store. (Shut off the water before removing the flapper.) You might not discover an identical match, but opportunities are you'll locate among the very same shape and size. If not, try a plumbing supply store (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>
