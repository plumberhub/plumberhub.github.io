If you see that your plumbing struggles with numerous blockages, leaks, and water pressure variation that no amount of repairs appears to stem, you need to seek advice from a reliable plumber about whole-house repiping as an option. Homeowners should examine water pressure entering into their home on a regular basis. Water pressure ought to be about 55 to 60 PSI; some city water pressure can be available in at over 100 PSI.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the firmness minerals. But the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is commonly pictured. If you have reasonably hard water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day sodium intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of sodium added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
