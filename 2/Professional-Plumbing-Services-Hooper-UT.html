The need upstream could trigger a reversal in flow.</p>

But if the leak concerns are frequent and every so often some or the other corner of your house has water leaking, then it's time to call a plumber to examine the entire piping system to perform house repiping. Several leaks shouldn't be neglected at all; else it may result in complicated flooding concern soon.</p>
