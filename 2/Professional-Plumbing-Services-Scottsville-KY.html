<h3>Fix A Leaking Water Pipe in Scottsville KY 42164</h3>
<p>Water that has been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been removed-- destructive. For this factor, WQA advises that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) ought to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not trigger this type of corrosion A softener is merely catching some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (usually salt or in some cases potassium).</p>
