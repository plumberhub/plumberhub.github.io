<p>Pressure Vacuum Breaker. You will need to get the producer's pressure loss info for the pressure vacuum breaker you prepare to utilize.

<p>Caution: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on a lot of rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts down. This is due to the fact that the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the irrigation system back into the water supply. The possibility of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however in many cases it should be much less water.</p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: A journeyman plumber and his assistant shown up during the appointed period. They disconnected the sinks, cleaned up and advised a tool to be used in the future.

<p>Testing need to be completed by a contractor registered with the Cross Connection Control office.

For testing of fireline backflow preventers, the State's Fire Marshal certificate is needed.</p>
