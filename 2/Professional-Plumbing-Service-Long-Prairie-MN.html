<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. However the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is widely pictured. If you have reasonably hard water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday sodium consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams.
