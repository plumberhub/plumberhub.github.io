<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one should first consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener components. When these aspects are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions found in difficult water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>

<p>The normal option is to have the defective pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is an option to think about if you reside in an older house - such as one built pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for many decades, but steel eventually suffers from corrosion and does not have the toughness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
