<p>Lastly, the most sophisticated and complicated backflow preventer is the reduced pressure zone device. This device includes no less than 5 separately operating valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other four. During basic water streams at design pressure, the 2 check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and advanced (if expensive) device is best used in critical areas where cross contamination could be a direct risk to life and health.</p>
