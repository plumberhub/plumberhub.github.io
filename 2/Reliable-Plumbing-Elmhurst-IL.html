<p>Reverse osmosis utilizes an applied pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to get rid of osmotic pressure and remove water molecules from the service with firmness ions. The membrane has pores large enough to admit water particles for passage; solidity ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft supply of water is free of firmness ions without any other ions being added. Membranes are a type of water filter requiring regular cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
