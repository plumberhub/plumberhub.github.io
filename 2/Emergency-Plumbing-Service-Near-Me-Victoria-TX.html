<p>Sewer lines have one essential function: carry wastewater out of a house or building. Although these homeowners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was certainly excellent timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe remained in good enough shape to reline before the problem got worse. Waiting simply wasn't an alternative. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a separated garage. At the least, it would have been a really expensive choice.</p>
<p>These types of warm water heaters are usually powered by natural gas due to the fact that it is more economical to power them with gas than with electricity. Gas water heaters cost more than electric water heaters to install initially, but end up costing about half as much to run - conserving you significant amounts of money on your utility costs in the long run.</p>

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers which might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no further repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my tenants tried the sink and it was still leaking. Due to the fact that he had another consultation, they called him back and he said he would not come back. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
