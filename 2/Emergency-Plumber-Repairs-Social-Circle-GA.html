<h3>Before Calling For Emergency Plumbing On Your Flooded Toilet Social Circle GA</h3>
<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undiscovered problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>If the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank, that is an indicator the tank is failing and will need to be replaced. If it remains in a garage and a little slow leak, schedule a quote as soon as possible and guarantee absolutely nothing is near the heater that could be potentially damaged. Leaking water heaters can burst causing water damage and flooding of homes.</p>
