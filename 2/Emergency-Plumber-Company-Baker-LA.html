<p>Find the ideal water softener for you. One common method for a home's supply of water to be infected is if the irrigation water lines, which might end up being polluted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines. The problem might spread greatly if that contaminated water were to backflow into the community drinking supply. A backflow preventer not only protects drinking water in specific residences, it also avoids wastewater in personal houses from receding out and polluting the public water supply.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Reduced Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is decreased by the # 1 Check spring (for instance, to 90 psi). This pressure distinction throughout the # 1 check valve maintains the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>
