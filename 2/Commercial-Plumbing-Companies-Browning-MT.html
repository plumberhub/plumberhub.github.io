<p>Leaky faucets and clogged drains are the most common sink repair problems. Common enough that many individuals opt for diy repairs. However sometimes even recognizing the leak can be an issue.

For double-bowl sinks, the best way to set about things is to use a continuous waste disposer kit including a discharge tube, baffle tee, and tailpiece. Such kits direct both drains to a single trap.
