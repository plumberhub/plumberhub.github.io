Nevertheless, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow occurs. No, it is not a regular occurrence, but it does happen regularly than you believe! When you don't observe the water was off for a few minutes, often it happens at night. An example is when the public utility has to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or hook up a new pipe. This makes building and construction projects quickly the most common reason for backflow problems. Fire fighting is another common cause of backflow.

This typically causes the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will happen in the surrounding areas.</p>
