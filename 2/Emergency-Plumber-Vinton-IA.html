<p>A backflow preventer is a means or mechanism to prevent backflow. The fundamental means of preventing backflow is an air gap, which either eliminates a cross-connection or supplies a barrier to backflow.

The primary kinds of mechanical backflow preventers are the reduced-pressure concept assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly.</p>
