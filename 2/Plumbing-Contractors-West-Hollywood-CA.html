<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the firmness minerals. But the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is commonly envisioned. If you have reasonably hard water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day sodium intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of sodium included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
