<p>Leakages are tricky. In time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capability to soften tough water. Through a procedure called regeneration, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, providing the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>
