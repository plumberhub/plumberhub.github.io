<h3>Five Things To Do Today To Avoid A Clogged Toilet in Loganville GA 30052</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Deal" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written estimate to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, given that I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned up from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was just 9 months ago. I feel that rates were increased since I had a "Offer". An Angie's list short article from March stated depending upon the marketplace and seriousness of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Pity on me for not bringing my previous invoice to be sure I wasn't getting price gouged.</p>
