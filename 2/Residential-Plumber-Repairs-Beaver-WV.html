<h3>The 5 Most Useful Tools For De-Clogging in Beaver WV 25813</h3>
<p>A toilet auger works the opposite method that a plunger does. Rather than dislodging the blockage with negative pressure, it really pushes into the clog, working even more into where the obstruction is taking place. The auger or snake" is then used to press the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear path for water to stream freely. The auger's corkscrew-shaped idea helps require it further down into the clog, making it much easier to clear.</p>
