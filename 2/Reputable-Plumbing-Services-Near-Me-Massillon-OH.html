<p>When choosing a licensed and insured  plumbing contractor is simply an easy phone call away, why run the risk of an insurance claim on a flooded home. A malfunctioning toilet is one household problem most of us would rather avoid. However, you can not disregard a toilet problem.

When your water lines are repiped, it just indicates old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with brand-new pipes. We discover that houses 15 years or older who have actually never had repiping work are the most likely prospects for water line replacement.

To find a suitable replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware shop. (Turn off the water prior to removing the flapper.) You may not find a similar match, however chances are you'll locate among the exact same shape and size. If not, attempt a plumbing supply store (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Products") or search online.</p>
