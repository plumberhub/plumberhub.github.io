When your water lines are repiped, it just indicates old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with brand-new pipes. We discover that houses 15 years or older who have actually never had repiping work are the most likely prospects for water line replacement.

To find a suitable replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware shop. (Turn off the water prior to removing the flapper.) You may not find a similar match, however chances are you'll locate among the exact same shape and size. If not, attempt a plumbing supply store (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Products") or search online.</p>
