The possibility of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or a minimum of minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however for the most part it should be much less water.</p>

<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. Over time, the deposits collect, till they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes. These deposits take place more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe.

If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs, it's time for a brand-new one.</p>
