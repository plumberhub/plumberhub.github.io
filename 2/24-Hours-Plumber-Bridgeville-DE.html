The GFAVB is a non-testable system and are good for back siphonage only for non-health threat or health danger conditions. They need to be set up downstream from any shut off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on a watering system you must install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It must also be installed a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB producers, and some local officials, need that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the greatest outlet). Some towns do not enable the use of GFAVB's. These systems will NOT avoid backflow pressure and can just protect against back siphonage.</p>
