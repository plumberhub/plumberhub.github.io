<p>When you eliminate the cap to eliminate the valve, inspect the washer for wear or cracks. Changing a bad washer is easy and inexpensive. But discovering the right washer might not be. The most typical washers are frequently available in the house centers and hardware shops. Other styles can be hard to find. Remove it and take it to the shop to find a match if you choose to hunt for a washer. Plumbers typically replace the whole fill valve instead of hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
