With sufficient tank capacity to meet variable peak load demand, the supply of water source can provide a constant flow of water. During hours of low demand, the water circulation can be utilized to fill up storage towers, tanks and cisterns, which then supply water for emergency use and periods when demand goes beyond the standard pumping rate. A supply of water source can take many forms, consisting of groundwater extraction well fields, free-flowing rivers, man-made or natural ponds, artesian springs, ocean water desalination plants, and rainwater run-off collection systems.</p>
