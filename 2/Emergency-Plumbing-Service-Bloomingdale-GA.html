<p>Some pipe materials are less expensive than others; some are more breakable and prone to splitting, displacement or other kinds of structural failure. Other materials are vulnerable to corrosion and rust while some are untouched. Certain pipe products have greater coefficients of heat pressure, making them more susceptible to structural stresses and stress as an outcome of temperature level change and ice formation.

Knowing the proper order for disassembly of the backflow preventer can be important.</p>
