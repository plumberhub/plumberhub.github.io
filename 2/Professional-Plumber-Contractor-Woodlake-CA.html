<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers which might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no more repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. Since he had another visit, they called him back and he stated he would not come back. A best bad plumber story.</p>

When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is utilized to ensure that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the community water system, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water held in the sprinkler system can end up being contaminated. If allowed to return to the water system, there is potential for the infected water to end up being a health danger. The backflow preventer is intended to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked routinely for effectiveness, as well as inspected yearly by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
