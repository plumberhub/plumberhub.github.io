But the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is widely envisioned. If you have moderately hard water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day salt consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams.
