<p>Though water line replacement seems like your home's equivalent of significant surgery, it's really something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with frequently. When your water lines are repiped, it simply suggests old copper and galvanized pipes are replaced with brand-new pipes. We find that homes 15 years or older who have never ever had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. You might be in need of water line repiping if you have an older house and are experiencing frequent and major leakages. If you do have frequent leakages, we find that repiping can in fact be the cheaper and better long-term solution.</p>
