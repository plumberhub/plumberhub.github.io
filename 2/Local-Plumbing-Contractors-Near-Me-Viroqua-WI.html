<p>Replacing your flapper might require slightly different actions than we reveal (Photos 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Discovering a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the job if you have an uncommon flush valve. To find a suitable replacement, switch off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware shop. (Switch off the water prior to removing the flapper.) You may not discover a similar match, however possibilities are you'll find one of the very same shape and diameter. If not, try a plumbing supply store (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>

<p>Once you have actually found the journey lever you want, all you really need to do is (CAREFULLY!) remove your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your brand-new trip lever, place it in the hole where your old journey lever was and secure it. Remember that since of the way a lever works, the locknuts for the majority of toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the right way. When you've protected the journey lever and are prepared to hook up your flapper, make sure you have actually got simply enough slack in the chain to guarantee the flapper is sealing firmly over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the method when you lower on the journey lever.</p>
