<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one should first think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener parts. When these aspects are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in difficult water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
