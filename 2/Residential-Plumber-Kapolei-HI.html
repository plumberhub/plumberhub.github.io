On top of that our typical water solidity level is in between 18-23 grains per gallon of water or for simplicity factors "extremely hard water".</p>

Reconnect permits are needed if the utility has been shut off to a residential structure for 6 consecutive months. The authorization cost is $99.00 which covers administrative and inspection expenses.

Include the Gas Piping Design template discovered below with your application.</p>
