<p>At Gary's Plumbing and Heating, we service all your water heating problems. The Minor Label Program is an alternative inspection program developed by the Oregon Revised Statutes (ORS). The program uses small installation labels and random inspections rather of routine electrical and plumbing authorizations for specific types of minor electrical and plumbing work. Your backflow preventer stopped working inspection due to extreme plant life. Please trim your plants and arrange for testing with a company from our certified tester list This should be completed within one month to avoid water service disruption.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Decreased Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is decreased by the # 1 Inspect spring (for instance, to 90 psi). This pressure distinction throughout the # 1 check valve preserves the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>
