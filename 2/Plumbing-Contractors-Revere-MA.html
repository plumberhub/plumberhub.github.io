<p>If you're living with decreased pressure from scale-ridden pipes, dry hair, stiff laundry, and endless device repair bills, you need a water softener. Hard water is not a problem that will go away on its own and the expenses sustained by difficult water will just continue to intensify. With a water softener, devices will undoubtedly fail sooner than their expected life expectancy. If scale continues to accumulate in your pipes, your flow rate will continue to limit and you run the risk of losing water pressure throughout your house. Hard water ravages hot water heater, and without a softener, your energy bills will continue to barrel skyward. If your water system is hard, the continuous cycle of replacements and repairs will continue up until your house is protected by a water softener.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite sensible. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
