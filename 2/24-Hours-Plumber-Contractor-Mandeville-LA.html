Although these house owners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was definitely good timing to camera the line prior to collapsing.

At the least, it would have been an extremely pricey option.</p>

If you can't recognize the location of the clog or quickly remove it yourself, Roto-Rooter plumbers bring all the tools of the trade essential to get your clogged bathtub drain back in service once again.</p>
