<h3>Residential Water Heater Repair and Replacement at Clayton GA 30525</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capacity. Throughout durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
