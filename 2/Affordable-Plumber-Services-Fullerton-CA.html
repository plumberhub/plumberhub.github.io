<h3>Choosing The Right Plumbing Service Fullerton CA</h3>
<p>Minerals in water are what makes certain water considered hard." Calcium and magnesium are the most common minerals discovered in water. Typically, minerals get there because groundwater will dissolve rock like limestone, or metals, like iron and the residues take a trip with the water till it is in your home. Water softening utilizes an ion exchange process to eliminate dissolved minerals that aren't as efficiently eliminated by mechanical filtration. These products are what causes hard water.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. However the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is commonly thought of. If you have moderately tough water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily sodium intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of salt included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
