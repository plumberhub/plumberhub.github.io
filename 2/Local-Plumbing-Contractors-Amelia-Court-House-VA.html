<p>It is very important to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Variations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will prompt an effectively functioning RPZ assembly to periodically release small amounts of water.

Appropriate drainage should likewise be offered.</p>
