<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years of ages and you need to hire a plumber for that burner package. The total repair expense may be in the $300 variety. A gas water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric hot water heater cost about $400 to $800). That repair bill is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. Go for the brand-new heater.</p>
