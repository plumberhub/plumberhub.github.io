<h3>Most Common Plumbing Emergencies Brooklyn NY</h3>
<p>The majority of homes or buildings that were built in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can begin to rust. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to offer weather condition protection. As the external finishing of zinc begins to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
<p>The connections of kitchen sink faucets are another typical leak-prone area. These can also be challenging to repair as they are usually located behind the sink, in cramped areas. The best method to tighten them is with a set of locking pliers. Wrenches take up excessive area and need a wide swing angle, which might be hard to acquire in small spaces.</p>
