<p>Water softeners add value to your operation by protecting your water-using equipment from bad performance and early failure. Some hard water problems are really noticeable, like sprayers and dispensers ending up being clogged. Other problems can go unnoticed, like scale on water heater elements and accumulation in reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. Unnoticeable or noticeable, these problems have actually real expenses related to them. Clogged components trigger replacement or refurbishing expenses and can annoy your clients. Scale buildup in your hot water heater will inflate your energy bills, and too soon harmed RO membranes will leave you with unneeded replacement expenses.
