Scale deposits likewise build up to plug plumbing fixtures and build up in other devices such as coffee pots and dishwashing machines, therefore affecting their efficiency.</p>

Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Normally, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to start with. Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in salt is small, however if you have actually been encouraged by a physician to follow a stringent low sodium diet this increase can posture problems.</p>
