<p>Backflow prevention secures safe and clean water supply from prospective threats. There are over 10,000 reported cases of backflow contamination each year. Backflow devices are needed by law and must be installed in accordance with plumbing or building regulations. There are various types of backflow preventers utilized in numerous applications. Your water heater stores water in a holding tank and makes sure that it is prepared for you to use. However, some homes run into problems where they lack water, and as a result, need to await the tank to refill and warm the water once again.</p>
