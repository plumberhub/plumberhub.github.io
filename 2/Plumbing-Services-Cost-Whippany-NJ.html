<p>It is necessary to comprehend that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Variations in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will prompt a properly working RPZ assembly to periodically discharge small amounts of water. Throughout a backflow condition, a big volume of water will stream from the relief valve. For this factor, RPZ assemblies should not be installed in areas based on water damage. Sufficient drainage needs to also be supplied.</p>
