For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense against leaks in between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can begin to harden and break or simply be so squished that it does not fill the area in addition to it utilized to, and you wind up with water all over the place.
