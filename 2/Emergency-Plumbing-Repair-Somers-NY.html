<p>Dry pipe systems generally are set up in big, unheated areas, such as parking garages. These systems have actually pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed.

<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the usual solution is to have the faulty pipes replaced. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is an alternative to think about if you reside in an older house - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for many decades, but steel eventually experiences rust and does not have the durability of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
