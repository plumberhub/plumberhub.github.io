However, there are several variables that can provide problems and impede the performance of your unit.

<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer kit will be attached to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws originally meant for the disposer discharge elbow. If your set just includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not recommended - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint. The consecutive 90 ° turns in such a setup can lead to inappropriate drainage. Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you may be able to cut off its elbow and use the rest as a straight discharge tube.</p>
