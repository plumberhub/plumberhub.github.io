<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health risk for individuals on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral content.

Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in sodium is minor, however if you have actually been encouraged by a medical professional to follow a stringent low salt diet plan this boost can pose problems.</p>

Rather than removing the clog with unfavorable pressure, it in fact pushes into the blockage, working even more into where the blockage is happening.

The auger's corkscrew-shaped idea assists require it even more down into the clog, making it easier to clear.</p>
<p>Dry pipe systems usually are set up in big, unheated locations, such as parking lot. These systems have pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed.
