When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not actually the flow of water pushing them down your pipes. Instead, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. Anything you pour down there won't go through when something obstructs the pipes.</p>
<p>Fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water functions should have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. If backflows occur from them, these water features are considered a health danger. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and location should be shown on building and construction strategies. Any backflow preventer installed on a fountain or garden pond should be evaluated upon installation and after that annually.</p>
