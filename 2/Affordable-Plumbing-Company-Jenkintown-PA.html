<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not recede against the needed instructions of flow. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to guarantee that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the local supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water kept in the sprinkler system can end up being infected. If allowed to return to the water supply, there is potential for the contaminated water to become a health risk. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined routinely for effectiveness, as well as checked yearly by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
