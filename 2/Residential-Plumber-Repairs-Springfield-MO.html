<h3>Necessity of Sewer Line Inspection in Springfield MO 65807 and Its Procedures</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Deal" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written price quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, since I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) and that was only 9 months ago. I feel that costs were increased since I had a "Offer". An Angie's list short article from March stated depending upon the marketplace and intensity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Pity on me for not bringing my past invoice to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
