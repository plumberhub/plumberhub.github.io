However the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is widely thought of. If you have reasonably difficult water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day salt intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams.
