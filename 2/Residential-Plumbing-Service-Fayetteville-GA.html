<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal solution is to have the defective pipes changed. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is a choice to consider if you reside in an older house - such as one built pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for numerous decades, however steel ultimately experiences deterioration and does not have the resilience of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
