<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal solution is to have the malfunctioning pipes replaced. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is an alternative to think about if you live in an older home - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for numerous years, but steel eventually experiences rust and does not have the durability these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
