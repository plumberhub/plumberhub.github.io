<p>In the typical repair, the old rubber parts should be removed and changed with brand-new rubber parts. When putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts, it is essential that just original factory repair parts are used. The rubber parts the producer produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was designed to use and altering the rubber from the original factory parts will affect the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
