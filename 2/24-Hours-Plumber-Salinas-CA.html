<h3>Replace Faucet in Salinas California</h2>
<p>Finally, the most complex and advanced backflow preventer is the decreased pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than 5 individually running valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other four. During basic water flows at design pressure, the 2 check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage occurs to the connected service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a sophisticated and reliable  (if pricey) device is best used in important areas where cross contamination might be a direct threat to life and health.</p>
