<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite affordable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs.
