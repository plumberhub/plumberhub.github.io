Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite reasonable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly delighted with their service.</p>

<p>The concern of leak can be attributed to any number of aspects which can vary from the tank is old and broken, to over-pressurization, as well as bad maintenance. The hot water heater tank must have some room to represent the growth that happens when heating the water. The thermal growth requires to escape, hence the need for an expansion tank to help manage the pressure. If the tank is old and worn, the force exerted by the growth occurring when boiling the water causes the reservoir to crack and begin leaking.
