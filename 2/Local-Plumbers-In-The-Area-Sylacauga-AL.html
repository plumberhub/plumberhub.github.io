<h3>Residential Water Heater Repair and Replacement at Sylacauga AL 35150</h3>

<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the usual option is to have the defective pipes changed. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is an alternative to think about if you live in an older house - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for many decades, however steel ultimately experiences deterioration and does not have the toughness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
