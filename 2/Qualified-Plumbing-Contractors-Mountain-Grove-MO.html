<p>CPVC (chlorinated polyvinyl chloride) is among the most typical types of plastic piping used in plumbing systems today.

Foul odor: A strong, unpleasant smell coming from your drains might show one of 2 problems: food blocking the drain, or a bigger issue in your sewage line.</p>
<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He said he would change the washers which might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no further repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my tenants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Since he had another appointment, they called him back and he stated he would not come back. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
<p>The professional, Kenny, was respectful, professional and informative! He asked me to take a look at the camera with him then explained my choices without attempting to oversell me!
