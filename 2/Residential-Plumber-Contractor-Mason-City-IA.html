When your water lines are repiped, it just indicates old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with new pipes. We find that houses 15 years or older who have never had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. You might be in need of water line repiping if you have an older house and are experiencing regular and significant leakages. We find that repiping can actually be the more affordable and much better long-term option if you do have frequent leaks.</p>
