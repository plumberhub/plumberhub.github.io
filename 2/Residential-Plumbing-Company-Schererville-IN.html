<p>CPM Plumbing focuses on swift service, accurate troubleshooting, and precision repairs so your service never ever has to suffer from downtime. One thing to learn about gas lines is they can be exceptionally harmful if there is a leak. While gas leakages are rare, you need to leave the structure instantly if you notice an odor like rotten eggs in your residential or commercial property. A gas leak can have almost immediate effects on those exposed to it, and it can even be fatal. Get out of the house and call us immediately if you have actually got a gas pipe leaking.</p>
