<p>Tough water is triggered by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners treat the water by utilizing salt and ion-exchange resins to eliminate these minerals. When the water comes in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions move out of the water and onto the active websites on the resin. Then they are changed in the option by the sodium ions.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits build up, up until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes. These deposits take place more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe.
