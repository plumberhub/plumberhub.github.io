Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new sodium ions.</p>
<p>Eventually, nevertheless, the beads reach maximum capability and can't bring in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank need to be regenerated, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank comes in. An on-board computer computes the quantity of water that streams through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regrowth automatically begins. For a three-bedroom home and household of four, regeneration typically takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
