The LADBS application must be submitted and paid for at least two (2) business days prior to the date of the occasion, AND, after you have acquired all other required approvals or clearances from all other agencies. Garbage disposals can be made of either aluminum or stainless-steel. Aluminum is more economical but more prone to leaking and deterioration. Stainless-steel blades are also more long lasting. People with a septic system will need to consult the septic tank installer or producer to discover which garbage disposal models are compatible with their system.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned up rapidly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, giving off from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to eliminate particles such as hard water scale, grease, silt, and sand deposits.</p>
