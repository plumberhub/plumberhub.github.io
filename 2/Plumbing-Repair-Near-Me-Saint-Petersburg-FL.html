<p>Dry pipe systems normally are installed in big, unheated areas, such as parking lot. These systems have pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler activates due to heat, the air is released, enabling the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is released through the open sprinkler head to reduce the fire.</p>
<p>Difficult water is caused by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners treat the water by using salt and ion-exchange resins to eliminate these minerals. When the water comes in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions move out of the water and onto the active sites on the resin. Then they are changed in the service by the salt ions.</p>
