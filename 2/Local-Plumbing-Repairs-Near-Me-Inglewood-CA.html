<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some parts may have very tight tolerances that need to be kept. An important thing to recognize on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the part. The guide is an extremely vital part of the design of each element. If the element is not fixed appropriately, the guide might restrict the motion (rather than stable or direct) of the part, which could cause the element to not work to its capabilities. Sometimes springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the element causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>
