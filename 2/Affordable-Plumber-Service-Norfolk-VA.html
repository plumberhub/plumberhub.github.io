This way you will not have a surprise cost on your hands when the day comes that it quits working.</p>
<p>Prior to choice and installation, refer to manufacturers literature for temperature ranges. All assemblies must be secured from freezing temperature levels and if installed where temperatures will reach 100 degrees F or above, a hot water type assembly must be utilized.
