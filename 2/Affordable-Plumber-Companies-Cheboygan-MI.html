<p>Camera are among the most valuable tools in the plumbing organisation. Determine the size of the water pipes in the house and around the home - they will help to figure out the water pressure that you'll have.

The pipes themselves ought to be at least a 1/2" in size to provide sufficient circulation.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Minimized Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is reduced by the # 1 Check spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure difference throughout the # 1 check valve keeps the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>
