<p>Depending on the extent of the clog, we might use a range of different methods, the most typical being hydro-jetting. Hydro-jetting is a sophisticated kind of drain cleaning where we use water under high pressure to entirely clean out everything inside your drains. Lay the waste disposal unit on its side and remove the electrical cover plate from the bottom. Loosen the green ground screw and eliminate wire ports. Disconnect garbage disposal wires from electrical supply wires. Loosen screws on the electrical clamp connector and get rid of wires from the waste disposal unit.</p>
<p>Single flush High Efficiency Toilets (HETs) utilize 1.28 gallons per flush. The most recent double flush HET offered by Bonney will use approximately 1.1 gallons per flush. This is where we disagree with InSinkErator. We recommend, as most plumbers do, to utilize disposals sparingly. Proper care and waste disposal unit maintenance will keep it running long past its warranty and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
