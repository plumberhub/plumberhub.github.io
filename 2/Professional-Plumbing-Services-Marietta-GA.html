<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and journey lever - tend to be the main focus of most repairs, there are lots of other little toilet parts that must also be well maintained to help avoid leakages and other toilet troubles. For example, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense versus leaks in between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can begin to split and solidify or merely be so squished that it doesn't fill the area along with it used to, and you wind up with water all over the location. Just like with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl bolts and washers can become corroded or so used that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we strongly advise also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make certain whatever remains in good shape.</p>
