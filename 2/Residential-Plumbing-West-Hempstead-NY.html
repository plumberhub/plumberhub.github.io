<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbing West Hempstead NY</h3>
<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not flow back against the needed direction of flow. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the local supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water held in the sprinkler system can end up being contaminated. There is potential for the polluted water to become a health risk if permitted to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is intended to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected regularly for efficiency, as well as checked every year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
<p>To replace a gas and repair line expect to pay $ 120 to $1,300. Repairing a gas line is actually changing a gas line - if it's faulty it needs to be replaced. The cost of gas line replacement is determined by the cost of labor and materials. The variation of the cost depends upon whether the job is an easy gas leak repair or a complete replacement of the gas line system. Additional gas line installation for new devices are charged independently.</p>
