<p>Last but not least, the most complex and advanced backflow preventer is the decreased pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than five separately operating valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other 4. Throughout basic water flows at design pressure, the 2 check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage occurs to the connected service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and sophisticated (if costly) device is best used in vital areas where cross contamination could be a direct threat to life and health.</p>

<h3>Residential Plumbing Emergencies Elmira NY</h3>
<p>The City of Bellingham requires a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or possible cross-connection. The backflow preventer might be needed on the water service line, within the building, or in both locations.
