<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like product coated with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water streams through the unit while the resin launches its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. Gradually, the deposits accumulate, up until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes. These deposits happen more frequently when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. If you wish to make two times as sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it, you might have your drain pipes expertly cleaned. It's time for a new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs.</p>
