<p>Seattle Public Utilities examines backflow assemblies upon installation and performs periodic re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies should be tested by a State of Washington certified backflow assembly tester prior to putting into service. A copy of the test report should be provided to us.

Whole-house models are proper for washing machines, or you can try laundry additive water softening products.</p>
<p>Prior to installing, your professional will turn off water and electrical energy to the area. Next, the old sink flange is removed and cleaned of any putty residue. Then, a new installing ring is installed to the bottom of the sink, the sink drain is connected, and the disposal is linked to its install. In this method, water is treated with a calculated amount of washing soda (Na2CO3) which converts the chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium into their respective carbonates which get sped up.</p>
