These are very important signs that should not be ignored.

<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. In time, the deposits collect, till they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits occur more frequently when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. If you wish to make twice as sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it, you could have your drain pipes professionally cleaned up. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs, it's time for a new one.</p>
