<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of a lot of repairs, there are a lot of other little toilet parts that must likewise be well preserved to assist prevent leakages and other toilet troubles. For instance, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense versus leaks in between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can start to harden and break or just be so crushed that it does not fill the area along with it used to, and you wind up with water all over the place. Similar to with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl washers and bolts can become so used or corroded that they spring a leak. We highly recommend also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything is in great shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>

Billy and Hector were our service technicians and they were fantastic. They rapidly discovered the leak and fixed it without making a huge mess.
