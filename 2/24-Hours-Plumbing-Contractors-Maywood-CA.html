<p>Lots of homeowners will see a clog and instantly grab a bottle of store-bought, chemical drain cleaner. While this kind of chemical might get the job done, it's in fact quite destructive to your pipes. Chemical drain cleaners often use lye as the active ingredient. Lye is designed to penetrate obstructions and dissolve them, but it also penetrates your pipes and produces weak spots that are susceptible to rupture.</p>
<p>These branching circulation pipelines form loops and networks consisting of water mains and supply pipelines. Water pipe vary in size from 6 inches, to 8, 10, 12, and 16 inches in diameter. The pipelines supply water for entire areas in addition to large commercial, residential and industrial complexes. Depending upon the circulation capacity, location and age of the pipe system, these pipelines are made from a range of products: polyvinyl chloride (PVC), high density polyethylene (HDPE), cast iron, ductile iron, copper, steel, asbestos cement, and even smaller-diameter enhanced concrete.</p>
<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound safe and clean water system. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage happens when unfavorable or decreased pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
