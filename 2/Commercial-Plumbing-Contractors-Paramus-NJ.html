However, there are many drawbacks to using these dangerous products - not least of which is that they normally contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a clog, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of presenting the threat of harm to your house and household.</p>
