Double Check Valve Assembly (DC): A DC is a mechanical backflow preventer that includes 2 separately acting, spring-loaded check valves.</p>
<p>When the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming drinkable water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
