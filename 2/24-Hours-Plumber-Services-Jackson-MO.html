<p>A toilet auger works the opposite method that a plunger does. Rather than dislodging the blockage with negative pressure, it actually presses into the blockage, working further into where the blockage is taking place. The auger or snake" is then utilized to push the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear course for water to flow easily. The auger's corkscrew-shaped pointer assists force it further down into the clog, making it much easier to clear.</p>
<p>As a company owner, malfunctioning drain and sewer plumbing can have a destructive effect on your organisation. Commercial drain and sewer lines experience a lot more tear and use than residential sewage systems and are more susceptible to blockages and blockage.
