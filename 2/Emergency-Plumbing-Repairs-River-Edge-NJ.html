<p>The list of things a food disposer can consume is fairly brief. Crisp or soft foods are great, but hard or stringy foods can be difficulty. Disposers can be dropped in their tracks by celery, eggshells and apple seeds, along with the usual kitchen flotsam, consisting of pop-tabs, scouring pads and twist-ties.

<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound drinkable water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or reduced pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
