<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers and that might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no more repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. Since he had another visit, they called him back and he stated he would not come back. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
<p>Diane Heether is a city resident of Belding and she is grateful for having a water softener set up in her house. It didn't simply enhance and make cleaning simpler, but it helps reduce waste too. Once it has passed through the valve, a backflow prevention assembly is a mechanical valve plan developed to avoid the reversal of the circulation of water. The two types of pipes that we choose to utilize for repiping are copper and PEX. These are 2 extremely different materials, but they both have incredible resilience and longevity.</p>
