Take your new journey lever, location it in the hole where your old trip lever was and secure it. Bear in mind that because of the way a lever works, the locknuts for a lot of toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the right way. When you've protected the trip lever and are prepared to connect your flapper, make certain you have actually got simply enough slack in the chain to guarantee the flapper is sealing securely over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the way when you lower on the journey lever.</p>
