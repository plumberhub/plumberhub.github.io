<p>Plainly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange website. When all the salt exchange sites are replaced with firmness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. When backwashing is complete, the softener can be returned to use. Some water softeners will instantly change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch.
