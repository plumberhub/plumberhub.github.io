<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming potable water supply, backpressure backflow in a building results. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building.
