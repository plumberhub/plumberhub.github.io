<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Fed Up With False Assures? Bad Odors - If nasty odors are emerging from your drain, this is a clear sign your sink is not effectively draining water. Undesirable odors are a direct result of waste-build up in your drain piping. When this build-up collects, it can cause more powerful odors, and more extreme piping problems. Without functional draining pipes, excessive pressure can trigger your piping system to break and leak resulting in expensive water damage.</p>
<p>Many sink concerns are repairable. If a sink is effectively taken care of, it can last for years and may just need replacement once a kitchen is refurbished. However, some instances require a sink to be changed. If it does not hamper the functionality of a sink, cosmetic damage is appropriate. However, damage such as deep cracks may need a sink replacement.</p>

It's filled with little, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The brine tank is where the sodium, or salt, is saved and combined with water. If you plan to drain  your automated dishwasher through your disposer, find the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Remove it by carefully punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). Leave the breakout plate undamaged if you will not utilize your unit to drain a dishwasher.</p>
