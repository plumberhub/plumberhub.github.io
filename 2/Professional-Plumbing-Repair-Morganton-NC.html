<h3>How to Fix a Leaky Faucet from the Kitchen in Morganton NC 28655</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adjust to your company' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capability. During periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's probably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
