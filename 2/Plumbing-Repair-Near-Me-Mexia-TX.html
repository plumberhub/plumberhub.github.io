<h3>Emergency Plumbing Tips For Your Everyday Plumber Mexia TX</h3>
<p>No hot water-- The lack of hot water is the most significant sign that there is something wrong with your San Antonio water heater. If you aren't getting adequate warm water for your shower, then you may have sediment that has actually built up in the unit and separated the water from the heat source. It's time to consult the experts if your water heater isn't doing its only task.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. But the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is widely imagined. If you have reasonably difficult water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily sodium consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of salt included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
