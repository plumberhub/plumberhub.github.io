<p>Foul Sewer Smell: Among the very first most apparent indications of a sewer issue is a smell of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the yard (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be an easy problem such as a broken water seal, or it can show a larger issue such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can avoid severe damage to your home. Even if the problem comes from with the municipal system, it's still smart to bring in the experts to limit the damage to your house.</p>
<p>The space under your kitchen sink has gotten more congested for many years. Initially, there would have been a hot and cold  water line increasing to the faucet (normally with shut-off valves for each) and a single drain pipe with a curved trap. Utilizing liquid epoxy-resin solutions, trenchless professionals can cure in-place entire brand-new areas of pipe within your harmed line, through little or even pre-existing entry points.</p>

<p>Hard water is caused by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners deal with the water by using salt and ion-exchange resins to eliminate these minerals. When the water comes in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions transfer out of the water and onto the active websites on the resin. Then they are replaced in the service by the salt ions.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. In time, the deposits collect, until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits occur more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. If you want to make doubly sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it, you might have your drain pipes professionally cleaned up.
