<p>Leaks are sly. With time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capacity to soften tough water. Through a procedure called regeneration, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a focused quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, offering the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>
<p>Next, inspect the body. Depending on the size and manufacturer, the bodies can be made from bronze, plastic, stainless-steel, cast iron or ductile iron. It is again essential for the repair professional to be aware of the solidity of the materials so that their cleaning procedure is not harmful. In the larger backflow prevention assemblies (2 - 10") the iron bodies will be coated to minimize any scale development or corrosion. It is very important that the repair service technician is delicate to the hardness and type of the various finishes utilized on iron body systems so as not to harm the protective covering.</p>
