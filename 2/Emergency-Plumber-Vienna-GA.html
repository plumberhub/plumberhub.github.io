<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He said he would change the washers and that may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no additional repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my renters attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not return because he had another appointment. A best bad plumber story.</p>
