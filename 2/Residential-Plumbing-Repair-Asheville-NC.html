As of July 1, 1999, the DPH requires an RPD on all lines that result in a fire lawn sprinkler with siamese connections, other than existing systems that currently have actually a DCVA installed (Ct. Regs. § 19-13-38a( c)( I)).</p>

<p>Plainly the resin is not a limitless exchange site. When all the sodium exchange sites are replaced with firmness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water.
