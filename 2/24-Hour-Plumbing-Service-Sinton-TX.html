<p>A recently installed hot water heater must not produce strange noises, however it will start to generate rumbling noises as it ages. The sounds get louder in time as the heater runs to heat up the water. Things aggravate considerably for homes with a high need for hot water. The reasons for the noises can be the buildup of sediments in the tank which should be flushed to bring back normalcy. If the water heater still produces rumbling noises even after it has been flushed, a water heater replacement may be required.</p>
<p>. The size of the population also impacts water need. According to Sankarasubramanian et al., The average per capita water utilize each day is higher in rural counties than city counties in all the climate regions, except in the Central and Southeast regions"1 with backwoods having less efficient supply of water systems2 mainly due to the relative lack of financial resources to upgrade and preserve their systems. So, the higher per capita consumption" of water in rural areas may consist of significant non-revenue water losses from their distribution pipelines. Such problems also factor into the need for backflow preventers at the points of use.</p>
