<p>Loose flanges are usually the result of wood rot. The flange screws just won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends on the degree of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>

<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. Over time, the deposits collect, until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits occur more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. If you want to make doubly sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it, you could have your drain pipes expertly cleaned. It's time for a brand-new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks.</p>
