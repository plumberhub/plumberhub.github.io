Changes in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will prompt a properly working RPZ assembly to regularly discharge small amounts of water. Throughout a backflow condition, a big volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this factor, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be set up in locations based on water damage. Sufficient drainage must likewise be offered.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a means or mechanism to prevent backflow. The standard methods of preventing backflow is an air gap, which either gets rid of a cross-connection or provides a barrier to backflow. The basic mechanism for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which supplies a physical barrier to backflow.
