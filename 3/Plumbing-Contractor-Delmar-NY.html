Changes in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will prompt a properly working RPZ assembly to regularly discharge small amounts of water. Throughout a backflow condition, a big volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this factor, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be set up in locations based on water damage. Sufficient drainage must likewise be offered.</p>
