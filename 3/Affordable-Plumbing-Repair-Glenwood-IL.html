<p>These valves have a great deal of versatility. They're the least costly of the backflow prevention alternatives, but they also offer the least amount of protection. An atmospheric vacuum breaker, likewise referred to as an anti-siphon valve, stops back siphonage with a floating disc. When pressurized and drops to allow air to go into the downstream piping when depressurized, this disc rises and seals off the air inlet.</p>

While NFPA recognizes that backflow remains a genuine health concern, it thinks about avoiding it outside the scope of NFPA 25. Rather, NFPA presumes that local or state requirements will ensure that backflow preventers are properly tested by certified workers.</p>
