<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits build up, until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits occur more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. You could have your drain pipes professionally cleaned up if you want to make two times as sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks, it's time for a brand-new one.</p>
