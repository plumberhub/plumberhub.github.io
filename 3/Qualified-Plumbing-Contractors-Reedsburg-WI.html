<p>Before choice and installation, describe producers literature for temperature ranges. All assemblies must be protected from freezing temperatures and if installed where temperatures will reach 100 degrees F or above, a hot water type assembly must be used. Consult makers specifications for recommendations. When searching for plumbing services in the area, specify with your requirements and ask candidates if they are licensed plumbers and if they have the sophisticated experience and licenses connected with a plumbing contractor.</p>
