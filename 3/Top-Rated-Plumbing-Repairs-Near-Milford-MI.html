Usually built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) enhanced concrete pipe sectors, and even tunnels lined with an impenetrable covering, these are big underground and aboveground pipes created to carry bulk circulation amounts of water to treatment plants, secondary storage facilities and circulation nodes where the circulations are transferred to smaller-sized branch circulation pipelines.
