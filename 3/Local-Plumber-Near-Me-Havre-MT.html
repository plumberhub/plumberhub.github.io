<h3>Plumbing Services Around Havre MT</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's cable, drain or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a newbie's DIY project. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
<p>Tree roots can be a major factor in impacted sewer lines. Tree roots grow in many different instructions and can get large triggering invasion of the lines underground. Another truth is that tree roots try to find water sources and will follow the source leading them straight to sewer lines ultimately growing right into them and triggering major sewer line problems.</p>
