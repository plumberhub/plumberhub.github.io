<p>When the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming drinkable water supply, backpressure backflow in a building results. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

<p>This post aims to attend to the typical misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes deterioration This is not the case: a properly configured water softener does not make the treated water more corrosive. Here are a couple of confusing truths that often lead people to this incorrect conclusion. Initially, naturally soft water is typically corrosive. Therefore, softened water must also be destructive, ideal? This is a fallacy since naturally soft water tends to be corrosive due to low pH and low TDS, while cation -exchange softening causes neither of these conditions.</p>
