Avoid flex pipe that can be bent into any setup, along with versatile rubber traps. Particles can easily capture in this type of piping while the piping's versatile nature does not provide needed assistance for the drain basket.

If the rot is only under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this kind of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
