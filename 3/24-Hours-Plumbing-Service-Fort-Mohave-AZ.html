<p>Unusual Sounds - If uncommon gurgling is originating from your drain, it probably requires an extensive cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it hard for the water to go through. Because of the tight space, the pipes typically make odd gurgling noises as water attempts to travel through a clogged pipe. This causes the water to bubble, as just small pockets of air are available, resulting in the odd noises originating from your sink.</p>
