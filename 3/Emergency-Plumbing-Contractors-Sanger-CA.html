<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of 2 classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on a predetermined schedule and after that go back to service. These work well for families that are on routine water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt due to the fact that they regenerate whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensing units, typically regenerate after numerous gallons of water have actually been softened. If you have a rising and falling water use schedule, such models are practical.</p>
