<p>In water system systems, water is usually kept at a substantial pressure to allow water to flow from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure might stop working or be minimized when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is an all of a sudden high need on the water supply (for example, when several fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe may permit polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
<p>Contractors and do-it-yourselfers are responsible for scheduling inspections by calling the office number noted on the building authorization. Inspections ought to be made after structure excavation (before putting concrete), after rough-in (before concealing work), and upon completion. NOTE: If malfunctioning work is found, the inspector will release an infraction notification, and a specific period of time is allotted to remedy the issue.</p>
