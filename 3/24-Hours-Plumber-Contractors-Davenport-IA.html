<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. However the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is extensively imagined. If you have moderately hard water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday salt consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams.

They must be set up downstream from any turned off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours.
