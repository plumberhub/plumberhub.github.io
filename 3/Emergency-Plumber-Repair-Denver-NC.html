<p>Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water system respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being breakable. This leads to micro-fractures and reduces the standard structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and might fail without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal effects. Incorrect installation is also a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to discover.</p>
