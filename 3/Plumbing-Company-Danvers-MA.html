<h3>Before Calling For Emergency Plumbing On Your Flooded Toilet Danvers MA</h3>
<p>A. Generally wax does not "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed issue. Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Seeing high water pressure at plumbing fixtures in your house? Water pressure in the house is similar to high blood pressure in the body - it requires to be controlled to keep the system healthy. When uncontrolled water pressure triggers damage to the plumbing system, this can cause emergency plumbing calls, like flooding. Having a water pressure regulator installed is FAR MORE cost-efficient than mold removal or changing flooring or drywall! So we suggest fixing or setting up water pressure regulators to protect your whole home.</p>
