<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. However the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is widely pictured. If you have moderately difficult water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily sodium consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams.
