Some parts may have really tight tolerances that need to be kept. An essential thing to recognize on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the element. The guide is a very important part of the style of each component. If the component is not repaired effectively, the guide might restrict the movement (instead of direct or consistent) of the component, which could trigger the part to not work to its capabilities.
