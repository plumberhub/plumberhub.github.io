<p>Polybutylene used inside your home can be found near the water heater or coming out of the walls to feed sinks or toilets. Caution: some plumbers set up stub outs" of copper when exiting the wall. Just because copper is showing does not indicate you do not have polybutylene pipes. You might need to make a little hole in the drywall to see the connection.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes with no nearby utilities or blockages, digging through and changing the pipe manually would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. However, if your damaged pipe runs under your driveway, any big trees or sidewalks, dig-free pipe lining might save you as much as $10,000 in repair expenses, if not more. Set a bucket under the P-trap and disconnect the drainpipes. Then get rid of the sink strainer. Get rid of any excess putty.</p>
