<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned up rapidly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, emitting from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to get rid of particles such as hard water scale, grease, sand, and silt deposits.</p>
<p>Please let EBMUD know of any situation that might require a backflow device. Often conditions on homes change that may require a backflow device, such as treating a boiler with additives or setting up a well with a pump. Sewer repairs are more than a hassle for your service, they can cause monetary losses and in some circumstances can stop your company completely. For restaurants having a drain back up or a sewer line break can be devastating. Even in a little workplace the concerns caused by even little drain problems can cause major concerns.</p>
<p>Pro Idea: If you're going to be draining a dishwasher through the unit, now is the best time to remove the knockout plug inside the dishwasher inlet. Use a hammer to tap a screwdriver into the inlet till the plug is broken off; recover the little piece of plastic from inside the disposer. This is likewise the ideal time to make the connections for a hardwired system with a pre-existing junction box.</p>
