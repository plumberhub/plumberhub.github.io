<p>Some water heater problems are small adequate to be efficiently resolved with professional repairs. Things like a dark pilot light, tripped circuit breaker, broken burner, or sediment accumulation are all simple and reasonably affordable to attend to. Nevertheless, certain concerns with your hot water heater might indicate that it's time for a replacement. Our Wheaton plumbers can help you identify which strategy is best for you.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned up quickly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, discharging from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to get rid of debris such as difficult water scale, sand, grease, and silt deposits.</p>
<p>A cross-connection is any long-term or temporary connection in between a public water supply or customer's drinkable (i.e., drinking) water system and any source or system containing nonpotable water or other substances. An example is the piping in between a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water system and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or watering system.</p>
