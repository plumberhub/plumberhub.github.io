<p>Your home's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and squander down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not really the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes. Rather, once they go down your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. Anything you pour down there won't go through when something obstructs the pipes.</p>
<p>Responsive flow technology works by continuously bringing tanks online and off-line in action to the water needs of your carwash. For example, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation technology, just one of the four tanks is required to soften water when the carwash isn't hectic. Nevertheless, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill. This responsive style enables the MTS to consume to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than conventional single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
