This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather protection. As the external finishing of zinc begins to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>
