<p>Mixing vaporized salt with rock salt is not recommended, as this might clog the softening reservoir. It is recommended that you permit your unit to go empty of one kind of salt prior to including another to prevent the event of any problems. In any case, when you're planning a water heater replacement, play it safe. Call your local department of inspections and ask if you need a license. And make sure a plumbing or electrical inspector checks your work.</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions also permit options to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems supplying devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the supply of water. This eliminates the need for a backflow preventer, since every time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
