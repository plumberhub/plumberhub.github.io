<p>Then attach the drain (and dishwasher hose, if appropriate). If your system is outlet-ready-- take note of this part-- make sure your disposal switch remains in the off" position prior to you plug the brand-new unit in.

<p>Inspecting the water meter is a terrific next action in your plumbing inspection. If the water meter is turning, close all faucets and examine. If it is, there is a leak someplace and this might be serious problem. Carry on to the valves. Start with the main shut down valve operation. When shut down, no faucet in the house should have water. This goes for every other shut off valve and their corresponding faucets. If everything is working appropriately, you are off to a great start.</p>
<p>A lot of need for plumbers will stem from new building and construction and the need to preserve and repair plumbing systems in existing homes and other buildings.

If there was an existing disposal attached to the sink currently, it's likely that the brand-new unit will fit the existing bracket. If not-- or if there is no disposal presently in place-- start by eliminating the old drain. A lot of drains are attached to the sink by a big nut underneath the sink that can be turned counter-clockwise to loosen up.</p>
