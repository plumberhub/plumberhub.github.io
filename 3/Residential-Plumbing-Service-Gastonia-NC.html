<p>Caution: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on many rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts down. This is because the pressure variations brought on by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water system. The probability of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of lower, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however in many cases it ought to be much less water.</p>
