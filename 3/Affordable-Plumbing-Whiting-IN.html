<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. In time, the deposits collect, up until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes. These deposits occur more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. If you want to make two times as sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it, you might have your drain pipes expertly cleaned up. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks, it's time for a brand-new one.</p>
