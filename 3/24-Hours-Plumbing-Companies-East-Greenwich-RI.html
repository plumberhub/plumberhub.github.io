<h3>No Hot Water - No Problem, Fix Yourself in East Greenwich RI 02818!</h3>
<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one should first consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener components. When these components are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in difficult water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new sodium ions.</p>
<p>If additional restorations are preferred, such as setting up a tankless water heater or expanding the water system to accommodate a remodel, this is when those extra changes will be made.
