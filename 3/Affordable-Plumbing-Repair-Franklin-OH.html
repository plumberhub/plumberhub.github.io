Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capacity. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's probably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
