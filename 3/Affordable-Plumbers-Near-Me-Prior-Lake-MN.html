Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity.

A common type of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
