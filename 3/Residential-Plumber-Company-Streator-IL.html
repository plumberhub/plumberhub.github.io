<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned up quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, giving off from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to get rid of particles such as difficult water scale, sand, silt, and grease deposits.</p>

<p>It's a strangely intricate clinical procedure, but simple to remedy. It uses salt to eliminate smells and minerals discovered in tough water- most typically calcium and magnesium. Water softener systems utilize resin beads that attach and draw in salt ions in the softener tank. Pumps press hard water through the resin beads exchanging hardness ions with salt ions, softening the water.</p>
