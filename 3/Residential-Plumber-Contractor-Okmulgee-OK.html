<p>Repipers start by covering floorings and furniture to safeguard them from water damage and dust throughout the work. They then find the pipes in your walls with little cuts into the drywall of the walls and ceilings. They will only get rid of as much building material as required to reach, detach, and get rid of the old pipe and replace it with new copper, PEX, or CPVC piping. To access pipes in the floor, plumbers will, whenever possible, enter through the ceiling listed below it. If you want, you can set up to have additional pipes put in at this time if you need to expand your water service for a remodel.</p>
