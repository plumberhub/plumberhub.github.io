<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Tired of False Promises? Bad Odors - If nasty odors are emerging from your drain, this is a clear sign your sink is not effectively draining water. Unpleasant stenches are a direct result of waste-build up in your drain piping. When this build-up accumulates, it can lead to stronger smells, and more severe piping issues. Without practical draining, excessive pressure can cause your piping system to break and leak resulting in expensive water damage.</p>
<p>Inspect to make certain it's not your garbage disposal that's causing the problem. A clogged disposal can stop up the drain, so run the disposal to see if that clears the clog. Then inspect it to ensure it's running correctly. If the disposal has overheated, you might need to flip the switch found on the side or bottom of the unit below the sink.</p>

<p>Galvanized piping is responsible for a minimum of half of the plumbing emergency situations that we face in your houses around the Bay Area. The preliminary problems that take place are the staining of the water, with brown water coming out of a faucet that may have a nasty smell. It can also cause spots in clothing put in the washing machine. If your home is over 50 years old, it's a good bet it's time to replace the plumbing, at a minimum cost of $2,000 and an optimum of $15,000.

<p>This short article intends to resolve the common misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes rust This is not the case: a correctly set up water softener does not make the treated water more destructive. Here are a few confusing facts that often lead individuals to this incorrect conclusion. Initially, naturally soft water is usually corrosive. Therefore, softened water must also be destructive, right? This is a misconception due to the fact that naturally soft water tends to be destructive due to low pH and low TDS, while cation -exchange softening causes neither of these conditions.</p>

<p>Water fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water functions must have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. If backflows happen from them, these water functions are thought about a health risk. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and area should be shown on building and construction plans. Any backflow preventer installed on a water fountain or garden pond need to be evaluated upon installation and then each year.</p>
<p>Tough water is caused by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners treat the water by utilizing salt and ion-exchange resins to get rid of these minerals. When the water comes in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions move out of the water and onto the active sites on the resin. Then they are replaced in the service by the sodium ions.</p>
