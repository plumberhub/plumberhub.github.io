Attach the backup ring, the fiber or rubber gasket and the mounting ring to the flange from below the sink. Make certain you snap the backup ring in place.</p>
<p>Prior to setting up, your professional will shut off water and electrical energy to the area. Next, the old sink flange is eliminated and cleaned of any putty residue. Then, a new installing ring is set up to the bottom of the sink, the sink drain is linked, and the disposal is attached to its mount. In this approach, water is treated with a calculated amount of washing soda (Na2CO3) which transforms the chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium into their respective carbonates which get precipitated.</p>
