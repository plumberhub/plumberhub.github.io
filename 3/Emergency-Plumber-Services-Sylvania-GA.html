<p>Now wait a minute, some people say, doesn't the water pressure in the water supply keep the watering water from going backwards? Yes, most of the time it does. Nevertheless, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow takes place. No, it is not a frequent event, but it does take place more frequently than you think! When you do not see the water was off for a couple of minutes, often it takes place at night. An example is when the water company needs to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or attach a new pipe. This makes building projects easily the most typical cause of backflow problems. Fire fighting is another typical cause of backflow. Fire trucks utilize substantial pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This typically triggers the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will take place in the surrounding areas.</p>
<p>When your bathtub drains or your toilet flushes is never an excellent indication, a weird gurgling noise. Do not depend upon a plunger to remedy the concern-- depend upon your plumber for sewer line repair.

Many fire sprinkler heads, other than sprinkler heads on a deluge system are kept closed by a heat-sensitive operating mechanism. Typically, this operating mechanism is either a fusible link or a glass bulb.  No matter the operating mechanism, only the sprinklers that are exposed to heat will open throughout a fire.</p>
