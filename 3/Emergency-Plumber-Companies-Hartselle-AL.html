They should be installed downstream from any shut down valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. , if an GFAVB is utilized backflow prevention on a watering system you need to install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.. It should also be installed at least 6 inches (150 mm) higher than the highest outlet in the system (some GFAVB manufacturers, and some local authorities, require that they be set up 12 inches (300 mm) greater than the highest outlet).
