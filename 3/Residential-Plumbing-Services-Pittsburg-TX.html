We now have cleaned up and checked the parts, replaced the rubber repair parts, re-assembled the parts and the rubber parts back into their components, cleaned the body and the seats and flushed the inbound water line. We are now all set to start the re-assembly procedure. Some designs require the elements to be gotten rid of in a specific order. These assemblies will also need the re-assembly in a specific order. Many parts can not be re-installed into the body unless the test dicks are exposed. As each element is put back into the body, it is essential to put them back in the appropriate location. It is also important that as they are placed back into the body, that no contaminant is connected on the elements or accidentally positioned in the body. The parts should be positioned so that the guides have the ability to preserve their created tolerances.</p>

<p>Plainly the resin is not an endless exchange site. When all the sodium exchange sites are replaced with solidity minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use when backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will immediately switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
