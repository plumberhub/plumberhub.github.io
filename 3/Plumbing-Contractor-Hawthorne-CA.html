Normally built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) strengthened concrete pipe sectors, and even tunnels lined with an impenetrable finish, these are huge underground and aboveground pipes created to bring bulk circulation quantities of water to treatment plants, secondary storage centers and distribution nodes where the circulations are moved to smaller-sized branch circulation pipelines.
