Remember that due to the fact that of the method a lever works, the locknuts for the majority of toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the right way. When you have actually protected the journey lever and are prepared to attach your flapper, make certain you've got just enough slack in the chain to guarantee the flapper is sealing firmly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the way when you push down on the journey lever.</p>
