<h3>Basic Plumber Tools For Any Job Amarillo TX</h3>
<p>When the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair procedure. It is necessary that the plumbing system be turned on very gradually to assure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air should be eliminated from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system must be examined to guarantee no valves were inadvertently left open or did not close effectively when re-pressurized. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are completely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>
<p>If the hot water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank, that is an indication the tank is failing and will need to be changed.

Leaking hot water heater can burst triggering water damage and flooding of homes.</p>
