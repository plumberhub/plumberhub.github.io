<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when looking for a practical solution, especially when easy plunging does not seem to work. However, there are lots of disadvantages to utilizing these hazardous products - not least of which is that they typically include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing an obstruction, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life.
