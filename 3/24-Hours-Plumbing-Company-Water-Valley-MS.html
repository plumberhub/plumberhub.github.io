<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Water Valley MS 38965?</h3>
<p>These valves have a lot of versatility. They're the least expensive of the backflow prevention alternatives, but they also offer the least quantity of protection. An atmospheric vacuum breaker, also referred to as an anti-siphon valve, stops back siphonage with a drifting disc. This disc rises and seals off the air inlet when pressurized and drops to allow air to go into the downstream piping when depressurized.</p>
<p>Warning: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on most rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts down. This is since the pressure variations brought on by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system. The likelihood of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or at least reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless in many cases it should be much less water.</p>
