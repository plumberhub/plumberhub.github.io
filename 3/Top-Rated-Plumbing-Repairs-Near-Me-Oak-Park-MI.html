<h3>Plumbing Services Around Oak Park MI</h3>
<p>A video camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it prevents the need to dig up your backyard. During a camera inspection, a sewer and drain technician runs a video cable television down sewer branch lines that lead from bath tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Using the images recorded by the camera, we can pinpoint any sewer and drain line problems, such as obstructions, tree root intrusion, misaligned joints, cracks, and other damage.</p>
