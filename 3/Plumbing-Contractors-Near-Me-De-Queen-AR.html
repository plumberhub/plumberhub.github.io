<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. But the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is widely imagined.

That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday sodium intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of sodium added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
