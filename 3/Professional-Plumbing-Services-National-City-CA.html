<p>Pictures provided by the American Backflow Prevention Association. The cost to repipe a house with copper pipe is between $8,000 and $16,000 or about $3 to $8 per linear foot. Replacing galvanized drain, waste, and vent pipe with copper costs $13 to $15 per linear foot. Copper pipe is more pricey than PEX, but it has some excellent benefits. There are numerous parts inside of a toilet tank, and a few of them can make a toilet bowl not flush. Appropriate toilet repair can have the toilet flush fresh once again.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes with no close-by energies or blockages, digging through and replacing the pipe manually would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. However, if your damaged pipe runs under your driveway, any big trees or sidewalks, dig-free pipe lining might conserve you as much as $10,000 in repair costs, if not more. Set a container under the P-trap and detach the drains. Then get rid of the sink strainer. Remove any excess putty.</p>
