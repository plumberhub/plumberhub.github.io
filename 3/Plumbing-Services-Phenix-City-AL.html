For instance, cleaning fluids may be drawn back from cars and truck washes; stagnant water from fire lawn sprinkler might go into the drinking waterline; bacteria and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water supply from air conditioning cooling towers; and chemicals from medical center's X-ray development might flow in reverse into the potable water system.
