The largest of these primary long-distance transferring pipes are described as aqueducts. Typically constructed of large-diameter (10 feet or more) enhanced concrete pipe sectors, and even tunnels lined with an impermeable finish, these are big underground and aboveground pipes designed to carry bulk flow amounts of water to treatment plants, secondary storage centers and circulation nodes where the flows are transferred to smaller-sized branch distribution pipelines. Many large cities need a number of aqueducts supplying water from geographically separated and varied sources.</p>
