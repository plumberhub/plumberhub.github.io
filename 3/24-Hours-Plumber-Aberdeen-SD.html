<p>It's Making sounds - As your water heats up, there are minerals that are falling and separating to your tank's bottom. This will cause it to work more difficult and can develop sound. If your energy bills are rising, a new, higher effectiveness hot water heater can bring them back down. All that needs to be done is blocking the inlet and outlet valves of the softener and open up the bypass valve, allowing hard water to flow to the storage tank and household taps. After that the softener can be detached, moved to its brand-new location and put there.</p>
