A house's service line (also referred to as a sewer lateral) ranges from the house to the mainline sewer in the street. In most cases, the property owner is accountable for preserving the service line from the house to the curb, and the City is accountable for preserving the mainline sewer and the portion of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
<p>Since commercial plumbing concerns have the capability to trigger such monetary loss and costly home damage, it is crucial to align yourself with a company that has the experience and personnel to make a distinction.
