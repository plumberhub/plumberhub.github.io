Trust Seattle's best kitchen plumbing experts, rather. Rotating the lower mounting ring tightens the seal in between the sink and the disposal flange when you hang the new disposal. The lower ring trips up a set of ramps on the upper ring-pretty neat! However the final inch or so of rotation needs a fair amount of force.</p>

<p>Please let EBMUD know of any scenario that may need a backflow device. Sometimes conditions on properties change that might require a backflow device, such as treating a boiler with additives or installing a well with a pump.
