<p>Water that has actually been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been removed-- destructive. For this reason, WQA advises that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not trigger this kind of deterioration A softener is just catching some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations while doing so (typically sodium or often potassium).</p>

Keep in mind that due to the fact that of the method a lever works, the locknuts for a lot of toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the correct method.
