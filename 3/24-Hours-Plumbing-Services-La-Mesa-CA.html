For this reason, WQA suggests that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not cause this kind of rust A softener is simply recording some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (typically sodium or in some cases potassium).</p>

When that occurs, you will probably need to call a plumber anyhow to fix your errors, and chances are they will cost more and be more difficult than if you had just called a professional in the very first location.</p>
