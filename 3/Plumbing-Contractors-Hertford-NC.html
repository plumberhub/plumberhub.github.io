Constant feed disposals are simple to operate: you run water in the kitchen sink, turn a switch, and feed the disposal with food scraps and compostable waste.

<p>Fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water functions must have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. If backflows occur from them, these water functions are considered a health danger. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and area should be shown on building strategies. Any backflow preventer set up on a fountain or garden pond should be tested upon installation and after that yearly.</p>
