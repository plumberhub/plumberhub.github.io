<p>The LAGBC is based upon the 2013 California Green Building Standards Code, frequently called "CALGreen" that was developed and mandated by the State to achieve consistency among the various jurisdictions within the State; lower the building's energy and water use; lower waste; and lower the carbon footprint. Constant feed disposals are simple to operate: you run water in the kitchen sink, turn a switch, and feed the disposal with food scraps and compostable waste. With this type of waste disposal unit, however, bottle caps, flatware, and other metal debris can often get captured in the blades. This can harm the blades and require repairs.</p>
<p>Fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water functions must have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. If backflows occur from them, these water functions are considered a health danger. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and area should be shown on building strategies. Any backflow preventer set up on a fountain or garden pond should be tested upon installation and after that yearly.</p>
