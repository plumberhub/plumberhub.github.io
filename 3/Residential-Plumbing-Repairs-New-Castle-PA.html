<p>Spotty dishes? Some underground rain gutter drains terminate in the sewer system instead of at the edge of your lawn. In that case, step from the downspout to the closest manhole, and use an auger line at least that long to guarantee you're cleaning the entire pipe.

<p>Loose flanges are normally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends on the degree of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
