<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound potable water system. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common type of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
