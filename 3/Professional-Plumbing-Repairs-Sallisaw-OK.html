<h3>How To Fix Burst Water Pipes Sallisaw OK</h3>

Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is developed because of the procedure. When galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe, a typical example of this is. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals.
