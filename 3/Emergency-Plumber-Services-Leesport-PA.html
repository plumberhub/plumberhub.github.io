<p>Leakages are sly. Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, decreasing their capability to soften hard water. Through a procedure called regrowth, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, offering the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>
