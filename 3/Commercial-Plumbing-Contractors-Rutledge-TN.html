<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Rutledge TN</h3>
<p>No warm water-- The absence of hot water is the biggest indication that there is something wrong with your San Antonio hot water heater. If you aren't getting adequate warm water for your shower, then you might have sediment that has built up in the unit and separated the water from the heat source. If your water heater isn't doing its only task, it's time to speak with the professionals.</p>
<p>Do yourself a favor and buy a versatile water system line. They're a lot much easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make sure to get one that's covered with stainless-steel mesh. For a great seal, hold the hose so it aims straight into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the ports. Make them handtight, then include another quarter turn with pliers. Connections that are too tight can really cause leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. Look for leakages and tighten them a bit more if required.</p>
