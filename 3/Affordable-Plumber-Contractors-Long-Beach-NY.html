If a clogged storm drain is not attended to in a prompt way, the chances are high that it will cause additional damage to the storm pipe, which will need repair.</p>
<p>Then attach the drain (and dishwasher hose, if suitable).

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers and that might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no more repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my tenants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not return because he had another visit. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
