<p>Organic debris, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's cable television, snake or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself task. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
