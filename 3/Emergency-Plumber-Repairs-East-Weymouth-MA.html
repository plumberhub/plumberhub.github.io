<p>Backflow preventers are also needed by the plumbing code. Other than within Coastline, the plumbing authority for Seattle Public Utilities consumers is King County plumbing (Public Health - Seattle & King County). The City of Coastline is the plumbing authority within Shoreline's city limits. When it comes to backflow preventer requirements, Seattle Public Utilities works with both King County plumbing and the City of Coastline.</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions likewise permit options to backflow preventers. For instance, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems supplying dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water supply. This removes the need for a backflow preventer, because every time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>

Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to supply weather condition defense. As the outer covering of zinc begins to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
