<p>Have used Plumb Crazy on three various occasions, the last involving a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our home. Billy and Hector were our service technicians and they were great. They quickly found the leak and fixed it without making a big mess. They, as with each person we have actually come across with Plumb Crazy, were considerate, timely, and extremely educated. I would recommend Plumb Crazy to anybody needing either little or large job plumbing work.</p>
<p>Tankless electrical water heaters come in two types. There are whole-house heaters that are big and powerful enough to supply warm water to all bathrooms, kitchens, and devices in a house. On the other hand, there are the point-of-use electric heaters that provide hot water to specific rooms or home appliances only. Both whole-house and point-of-use heaters work the same way. The only distinction is the quantity of water they can heat up at any offered time. Likewise, whole-house systems are substantially more expensive than the point of use systems.</p>
