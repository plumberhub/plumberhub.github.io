<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like product covered with positively charged salt ions.

The water flows through the system while the resin launches its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
