When washing products are used in difficult water - difficult water ions bond with surfactants making them unavailable to bond with water. Any location where water is consisted of is susceptible to clogged drains.

When the water can be found in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions transfer out of the water and onto the active sites on the resin. Then they are replaced in the option by the sodium ions.</p>
