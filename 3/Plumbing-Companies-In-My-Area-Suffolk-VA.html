<p>Leaks are sly. In time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capability to soften hard water. Through a process called regrowth, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the firmness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain.

Sanford & Boy plumbing offers sink repair and replacement services to all Lake Elsinore, Temecula, Murrieta, Sun City, Menifee, Wildomar, and surrounding locations. Throughout regrowth, salted water from the salt water tank streams up the fill tube and into the softener tank. A rinse cycle commences and the salty water washes the mineral deposits off the resin beads. The regenerated water and the mineral deposits are flushed out the discharge hose. The system then reverts back to softening the incoming water.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health danger for individuals on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Generally, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to begin with. Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions.
