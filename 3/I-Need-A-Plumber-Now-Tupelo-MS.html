<h3>Warning Signs of Sewer Mainline Pipe Clogs in Tupelo MS 38801</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Offer" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed price quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, given that I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned up from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was just 9 months back. I feel that prices were increased due to the fact that I had a "Deal". An Angie's list short article from March said depending upon the marketplace and seriousness of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my past invoice to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>
