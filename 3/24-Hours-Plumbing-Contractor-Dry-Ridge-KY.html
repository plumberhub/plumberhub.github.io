<p>Many homeowners will notice a clog and right away grab a bottle of store-bought, chemical drain cleaner. While this kind of chemical may do the job, it's in fact rather harmful to your pipes. Chemical drain cleaners typically use lye as the active ingredient. Lye is created to eat through clogs and liquify them, but it also eats through your pipes and develops weak points that are susceptible to burst.</p>
<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He said he would change the washers which might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no further repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not return since he had another visit. A best bad plumber story.</p>
<p>As soon as safely outside, homeowners can contact their local utility company and a licensed professional plumber to repair the leak and discover. The water heater is an important element of the plumbing system, and it needs to last for several years as long as you get the best maintenance and repairs to avoid any problems.
