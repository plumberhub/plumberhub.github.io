You may need to increase or reduce the vent size to guarantee the best draft. CAUTION: If you're unsure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>The connections of kitchen sink faucets are another typical leak-prone area. These can also be challenging to repair as they are usually located behind the sink, in cramped spaces.
