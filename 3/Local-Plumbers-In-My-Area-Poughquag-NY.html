<p>Have utilized Plumb Crazy on three different occasions, the last involving a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our house. Billy and Hector were our technicians and they were great. They quickly discovered the leak and repaired it without making a huge mess. They, similar to each person we have actually experienced with Plumb Crazy, were polite, prompt, and really knowledgeable. I would recommend Plumb Crazy to anybody needing either big or little task plumbing work.</p>
<p>Pro Pointer: If you're going to be draining a dishwasher through the unit, now is the best time to remove the knockout plug inside the dishwasher inlet. Use a hammer to tap a screwdriver into the inlet until the plug is broken off; obtain the small piece of plastic from inside the disposer. This is likewise the perfect time to make the connections for a hardwired unit with a pre-existing junction box.</p>
