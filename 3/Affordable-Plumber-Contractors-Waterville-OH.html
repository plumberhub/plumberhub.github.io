Remember that since of the way a lever works, the locknuts for a lot of toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the proper way. When you have actually secured the trip lever and are all set to hook up your flapper, ensure you have actually got just enough slack in the chain to make sure the flapper is sealing firmly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the method when you push down on the trip lever.</p>
