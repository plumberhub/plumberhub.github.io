<p>Leaks are tricky. In time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capacity to soften tough water. Through a process called regrowth, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, offering the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>
