<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one should initially consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener elements. When these aspects are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new sodium ions.</p>
