<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like product covered with positively charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water flows through the system while the resin releases its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
