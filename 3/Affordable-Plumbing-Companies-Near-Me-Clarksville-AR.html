<h2>Tips To Hire Certified Plumbing Contractors in Clarksville</h2>

<p>Leaks are tricky. Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, diminishing their capacity to soften difficult water. Through a procedure called regeneration, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the firmness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, supplying the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>
