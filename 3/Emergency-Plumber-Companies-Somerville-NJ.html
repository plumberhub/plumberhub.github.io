<h3>Pipe Leak Repair in Somerville New Jersey</h2>
<p>In some communities, house water softeners drain to municipal wastewater treatment plants, which are not designed to remove chloride. The chloride goes through the treatment plant and winds up in our streams and lakes. In houses with personal wells and house softeners, chloride drains to the house's septic system and after that winds up in lakes and streams.</p>
<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He said he would change the washers and that may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no additional repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Because he had another visit, they called him back and he stated he would not come back. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
