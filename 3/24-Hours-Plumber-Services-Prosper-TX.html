For gas water heaters, a particular gas line needs to be installed and a feasible source of gas developed. Another feature of an electric water heater is that they do not need any ventilation. Gas models need to be ventilated properly using vents and ducts in order to function properly. With electrical designs, you will not need to install any brand-new vents or ducts in your house.</p>
