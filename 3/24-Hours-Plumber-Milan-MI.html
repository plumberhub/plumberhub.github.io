<p>The easiest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc attached to an atmospheric vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop listed below that of the outdoors air. This activates the disc to open, permitting air to bring back and get in the valve pressure equivalent to ambient atmospheric requirement. This remediation of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
