When you tighten the locknut in location, excess putty will squeeze out in between the new basket strainer and the sink. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to insert the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without catching on the gasket.</p>
