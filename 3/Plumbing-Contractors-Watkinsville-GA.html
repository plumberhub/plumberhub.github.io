<p>Like a lot of household devices, your water heater is among those things that gets taken for given - up until it goes kaput. Then it garners all the attention it is worthy of. On average, the life-span of the majority of water heaters is between ten and fifteen years. Naturally, this lifespan varies according to the frequency of use and care and maintenance.

<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Picture 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on particular new sinks, but these will be labeled to that impact. Use a non-water-based silicone if you can't use plumber's putty. When you tighten up the locknut in place, excess putty will squeeze out between the new basket strainer and the sink. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to insert the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
