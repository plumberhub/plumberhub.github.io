<p>Hard water is caused by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners treat the water by utilizing salt and ion-exchange resins to eliminate these minerals. When the water is available in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions move out of the water and onto the active websites on the resin. Then they are replaced in the service by the salt ions.</p>
<p>The appropriate repair of a backflow preventer requires lots of products to be assessed. The hydraulic conditions present at the backflow prevention assembly should be evaluated. The installation must be assessed to ensure it does not prevent the operations of the assembly. Test information need to be accumulated to determine the functions of each element. The backflow prevention assembly should be disassembled and parts replaced with original factory parts. The backflow prevention assembly need to be evaluated once again to be sure it was effectively fixed. Comparing the test results from the repaired backflow prevention assembly to the manufacturers flow diagram is necessary to guarantee it was repaired appropriately. An appropriately fixed assembly must provide years of security.</p>
