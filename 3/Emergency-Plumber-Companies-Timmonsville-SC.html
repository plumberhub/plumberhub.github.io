We now have cleaned up and checked the parts, changed the rubber repair parts, re-assembled the parts and the rubber parts back into their elements, cleaned the body and the seats and flushed the incoming water line. We are now all set to start the re-assembly process. Some models require the components to be gotten rid of in a particular order. These assemblies will likewise need the re-assembly in a specific order. Numerous elements can not be re-installed into the body unless the test cocks are exposed. As each component is put back into the body, it is important to put them back in the proper place.
