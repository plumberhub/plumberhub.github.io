While NFPA recognizes that backflow remains a legitimate health concern, it thinks about preventing it outside the scope of NFPA 25. Rather, NFPA presumes that local or state requirements will ensure that backflow preventers are correctly tested by certified personnel.</p>
<p>The concern of leakage can be credited to any number of factors which can vary from the tank is old and worn out, to over-pressurization, as well as poor maintenance. The water heater tank need to have some room to represent the growth that occurs when heating the water. The thermal growth needs to escape, hence the need for a growth tank to help manage the pressure.

The treatment for this is to replace the water heater system.</p>

Without constant testing and servicing, these systems can enable contaminated water to stream easily within your supply pipes, developing a major health risk to building residents.
