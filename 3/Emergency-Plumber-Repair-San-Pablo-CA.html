<p>Sinkholes don't just take place in your lawn, regrettably, when a sewer line breaks. The best you can hope for is to find out quickly if there is a leak in a part of the sewer line running below your home's structure. Otherwise, as the leaky sewer line spills out below your house, a sinkhole will cause the structure to move and develop fractures. In this case, you'll need skilled plumbers as well as structure repair specialists.</p>
<p>Dry pipe systems normally are installed in large, unheated areas, such as parking garages. These systems have pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler activates due to heat, the air is released, permitting the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is released through the open sprinkler head to reduce the fire.</p>
