<p>These valves have a lot of flexibility. They're the least costly of the backflow prevention options, but they likewise provide the least amount of security. A climatic vacuum breaker, also referred to as an anti-siphon valve, stops back siphonage with a drifting disc. When pressurized and drops to permit air to get in the downstream piping when depressurized, this disc seals and rises off the air inlet.</p>
<p>Common locations where backflow presenters are required are swimming pool automated refill lines, refill lines for garden ponds and ornamental fountains, and landscape irrigation systems. We also need hose bibb vacuum breakers on all external faucets to avoid backflow from garden hose pipes. Gas line services you can constantly rely on. Home Service Plus, a non-regulated offering of CenterPoint Energy, is among a wide array of certified sources you can choose when you want to purchase home comfort products and services, including repair of customer-owned interior gas pipes.</p>
