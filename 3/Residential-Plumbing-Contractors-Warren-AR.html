<p>Leakages are sneaky. With time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, diminishing their capability to soften tough water. Through a procedure called regeneration, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, providing the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>
