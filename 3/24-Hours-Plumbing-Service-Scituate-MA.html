<h3>Quality Plumbing Service Scituate MA</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's drain, cable or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a novice's DIY task. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>

I will absolutely utilize Clog Dawg once again. Installing a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical per hour rate of $25 to $70. These rates are in addition to the cost of the disposal system. The total you pay may be higher if your plumber has a minimum callout fee that is greater than the labor cost for the work.</p>
