<h2>Tips To Hire Certified Plumbing Services in Kittery</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Video cameras are among the most important tools in the plumbing business. Identify the size of the water pipes in the home and around the home - they will help to identify the water pressure that you'll have. For water pressure to be sufficient, the lines need to be 3/4" to one inch straight from the main water source for the home. The pipes themselves must be at least a 1/2" in size to supply appropriate circulation.</p>
<p>As water goes through the supply pipes and then out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water dishwasher, boiler, and heater, it's leaving behind hard, crusty mineral deposits. Initially, these small deposits are harmless, but over time they develop and ultimately clog pipes, seize valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In severe cases, hard-water deposits can dramatically limit the water circulation, which puts undue pressure on the whole plumbing system.</p>
