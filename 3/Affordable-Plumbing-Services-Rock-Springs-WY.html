Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capability. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's perhaps the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
