<p>In reality, reverse flow testing designed to make sure that backflow preventers avoid backflow was eliminated from NFPA 25 in 2011. While NFPA recognizes that backflow remains a legitimate health concern, it considers avoiding it outside the scope of NFPA 25. Rather, NFPA presumes that local or state requirements will ensure that backflow preventers are correctly evaluated by certified personnel.</p>
<p>An evaluation of the hydraulic conditions present at the assembly need to then be evaluated. There are hydraulic conditions such as pressure fluctuations and disc compression that could result in incorrect information on the functions of the backflow prevention assembly. Hydraulic conditions such as water hammer can lead to extreme pressure spikes that could harm components. The results of raised temperature level can likewise trigger excessive pressure conditions which could harm the parts in the components. These and other unfavorable results from the hydraulic conditions must be acknowledged and their cause corrected. If parts are changed and the hydraulic conditions are not remedied, the new parts can quickly be made inoperative.</p>
