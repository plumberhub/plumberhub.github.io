<p>If you notice a smell or undesirable smell originating from your unit, which is not uncommon, think about buying a flange that can seal up and cover the top of the disposal, where nasty smells can leave.

When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration automatically begins. For a three-bedroom house and household of 4, regeneration typically occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
