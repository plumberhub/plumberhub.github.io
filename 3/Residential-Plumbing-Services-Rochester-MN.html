<p>Warning: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on a lot of rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off.

The likelihood of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless for the most part it should be much less water.</p>
