Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
