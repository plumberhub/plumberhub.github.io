However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow occurs. No, it is not a regular occurrence, but it does happen more frequently than you believe! Typically it takes place in the evening when you don't observe the water was off for a couple of minutes. An example is when the public utility needs to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or connect a new pipe. This makes construction jobs quickly the most common cause of backflow problems. Fire fighting is another typical reason for backflow. Fire trucks use huge pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This often causes the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will happen in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
