Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation need, tanks come online to include circulation rate capability. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line.
