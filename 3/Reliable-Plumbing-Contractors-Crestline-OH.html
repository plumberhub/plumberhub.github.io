<p>Run the warm water. Hot water is your good friend, especially for your kitchen sink. Even if you are very cautious with what you put down your sinks, food remnants and cooking oils still get away down our drains - especially the kitchen sink. Running the warm water after you've used your sink helps clear particles and separate food and oils and keep your drain clear.</p>
<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Photo 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on particular brand-new sinks, however these will be identified to that impact. Use a non-water-based silicone if you can't use plumber's putty. When you tighten the locknut in location, excess putty will squeeze out between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel.
