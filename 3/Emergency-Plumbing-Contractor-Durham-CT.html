<h3>Emergency Plumbing Services Durham CT</h3>
<p>A. Generally wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered problem. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Repiping a home takes three to five days with an average cost from $5,500 to $8,500, depending upon home's size and the company doing the work. Wood suggests inspecting the qualifications of various companies and getting estimates. With all this in mind, it's clear why water softeners are so popular: They remain the least pricey and most efficient way to rid your water of problematic minerals.</p>
