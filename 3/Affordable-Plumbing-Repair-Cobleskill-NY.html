<p>It's Making Noise - As your water heats, there are minerals that are falling and separating to your tank's bottom. This will cause it to work harder and can create sound. If your energy costs are rising, a new, greater efficiency hot water heater can bring them back down. All that needs to be done is blocking the inlet and outlet valves of the softener and open up the bypass valve, permitting hard water to stream to the storage tank and household taps. After that the softener can be disconnected, moved to its new place and put there.</p>
<p>Pro Pointer: If you're going to be draining a dishwasher through the unit, now is the best time to eliminate the knockout plug inside the dishwasher inlet. Utilize a hammer to tap a screwdriver into the inlet up until the plug is broken off; retrieve the little piece of plastic from inside the disposer. This is likewise the perfect time to make the connections for a hardwired unit with a pre-existing junction box.</p>
