<p>Sewer lines have one important role: bring wastewater out of a home or structure. Although these homeowners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was certainly good timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe was in good enough shape to reline before the problem got worse. Waiting just wasn't an option. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a removed garage. At the least, it would have been a very costly alternative.</p>
<p>Some states require pipefitters and steamfitters to be licensed; they may likewise need an unique license to work on gas lines.
