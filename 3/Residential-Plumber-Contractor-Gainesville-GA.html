<h3>The Importance Of Plumbers And Plumbing Services Gainesville GA</h3>

<p>This short article aims to deal with the common misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes rust This is not the case: an appropriately set up water softener does not make the treated water more corrosive. Here are a couple of confusing facts that often lead individuals to this incorrect conclusion. First, naturally soft water is generally destructive. For that reason, softened water must also be corrosive, ideal? This is a fallacy due to the fact that naturally soft water tends to be corrosive due to low pH and low TDS, while cation -exchange softening causes neither of these conditions.</p>
