It is important that the plumbing system be switched on extremely gradually to assure no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air needs to be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system must be inspected to ensure no valves were unintentionally left open or did not close properly. When the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are completely open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>
