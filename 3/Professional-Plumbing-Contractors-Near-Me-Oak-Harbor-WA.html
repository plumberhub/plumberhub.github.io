<h3>How To Repair Your Water Heater at Oak Harbor WA 98277</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow need, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capability. During durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
