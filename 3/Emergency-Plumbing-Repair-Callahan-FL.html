<p>A toilet auger works the opposite way that a plunger does. Rather than dislodging the obstruction with negative pressure, it really presses into the obstruction, working further into where the blockage is occurring. The auger or snake" is then used to press the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear path for water to stream freely. The auger's corkscrew-shaped pointer assists require it further down into the clog, making it easier to clear.</p>
