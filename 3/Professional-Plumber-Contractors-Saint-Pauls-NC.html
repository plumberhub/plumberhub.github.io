<p>Unusual Sounds - If uncommon gurgling is coming from your drain, it most likely needs an extensive cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it tough for the water to pass through. The pipes often make weird gurgling noises as water attempts to pass through a clogged pipe because of the tight space.

<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a versatile water supply line. They're a lot simpler to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make certain to get one that's covered with stainless-steel mesh. For a good seal, hold the hose so it intends straight into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the connectors. Make them handtight, then add another quarter turn with pliers. Connections that are too tight can really trigger leaks or spin the fill valve inside the tank. Look for leakages and tighten them a bit more if needed.</p>
