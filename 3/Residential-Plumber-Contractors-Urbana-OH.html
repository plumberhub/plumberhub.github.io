Is your hot water heater making noises, or do you see rusty colored water in your house? If you have any of these issues, your water heater might need maintenance, repairs and even a replacement.

Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Usually, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to begin with. Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in sodium is minor, but if you've been recommended by a medical professional to follow a strict low salt diet plan this boost can pose problems.</p>
