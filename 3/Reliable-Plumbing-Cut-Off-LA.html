When the water is available in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions move out of the water and onto the active websites on the resin. Then they are replaced in the solution by the sodium ions.</p>

If it's mainly yellow, or if it's sooty under there, your flue might be clogged, which is a dangerous situation. Contact a professional to examine it out.
