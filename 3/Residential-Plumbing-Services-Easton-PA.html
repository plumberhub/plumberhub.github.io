<p>Minerals in water are what makes certain water considered hard." Calcium and magnesium are the most common minerals found in water. Typically, minerals arrive due to the fact that groundwater will liquify rock like limestone, or metals, like iron and the residues take a trip with the water until it is in your home. Water softening utilizes an ion exchange procedure to remove dissolved minerals that aren't as efficiently removed by mechanical filtration. These products are what triggers difficult water.</p>
<p>The leak from a pipe fitting that costs less than a dollar can quickly cause countless dollars in water damage, interrupt your household for weeks, and throw your remodel way off schedule.
