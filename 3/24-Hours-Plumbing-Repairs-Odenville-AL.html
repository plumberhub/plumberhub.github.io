<p>Cold showers? High energy bills? It might be time for a new warm water heater. But in order to profit of a new energy-efficient appliance, you'll need to have it installed effectively. A hot water heater that is not installed properly can result in water damage, scalding temperature levels, or even a fire. That's why installation is best left to professional plumbers who understand the ins and outs of your plumbing system.</p>
<p>Warning: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on most rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts off. This is due to the fact that the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the watering system back into the water supply. The possibility of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, nevertheless for the most part it should be much less water.</p>
