A great rule of thumb is to replace faucets that reveal deterioration, rust, fractures, and otherwise deep damages. Damaged and corroded parts make repairs difficult and expensive, indicating a faucet installation is more rewarding. Repairs are the appropriate fix for issues such as missing out on or damaged washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other small elements of the whole fixture. If these repairs and replacements do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of changing your faucet, then we recommend a brand-new faucet installation.</p>
<p>Next, check the body. Depending upon the size and producer, the bodies can be made of bronze, plastic, stainless steel, cast iron or ductile iron.

In the bigger backflow prevention assemblies (2 - 10") the iron bodies will be coated to lessen any scale development or corrosion. It is essential that the repair professional is sensitive to the solidity and kind of the different finishes used on iron body systems so as not to damage the protective finish.</p>
