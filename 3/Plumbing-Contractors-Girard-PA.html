Principal types consist of: Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was produced experimentally in the 19th century but did not end up being useful to manufacture until 1926, when Waldo Semon of BF Goodrich Co. established a method to plasticize PVC, making it much easier to process. PVC pipe began to be produced in the 1940s and was in broad use for Drain-Waste-Vent piping throughout the restoration of Germany and Japan following WWII. In the 1950s, plastics manufacturers in Western Europe and Japan began producing acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) pipe.

<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal option is to have the faulty pipes replaced.

Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for numerous years, but steel eventually suffers from deterioration and lacks the durability of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
