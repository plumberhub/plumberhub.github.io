<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health threat for individuals on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Normally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to start with. More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in salt is small, however if you've been recommended by a doctor to follow a stringent low sodium diet this boost can posture problems.</p>
<p>When the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean water supply, backpressure backflow in a building results. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or decreased pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common kind of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
