<p>When the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated throughout the repair process. It is very important that the plumbing system be turned on very gradually to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air must be removed from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system should be checked to ensure no valves were inadvertently exposed or did not close effectively when re-pressurized. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are totally open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>

<p>Passive Purge - Approximately 2007, some homes were allowed to bypass a physical backflow device in lieu of a system where stagnant water was purged from the system with usage of one or more toilets in the home. Generally, the water system to one of the upper floor toilets was piped from the fire sprinkler system; upon each use, fresh water was introduced into the fire lawn sprinkler.</p>
<p>Testing should be finished by a contractor registered with the Cross Connection Control workplace. The contractor must have a legitimate, current plumbing license, existing insurance, backflow preventer testing accreditation, and currently adjusted test kit. For testing of fireline backflow preventers, the State's Fire Marshal certificate is required.</p>
