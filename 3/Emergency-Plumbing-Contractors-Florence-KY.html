<h3>Useful Tips for Water Heater Repair at Florence KY 41042</h3>
<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of many repairs, there are plenty of other little toilet parts that ought to also be well preserved to help prevent leakages and other toilet difficulties. For instance, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense against leakages between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can start to harden and crack or simply be so squished that it doesn't fill the area as well as it used to, and you wind up with water all over the place. Similar to with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl washers and bolts can end up being corroded or so worn that they spring a leak. We strongly advise also changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything is in tip-top shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
