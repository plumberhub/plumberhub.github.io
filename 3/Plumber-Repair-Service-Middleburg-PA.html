<h3>Most Common Residential Plumbing Emergencies Middleburg PA</h3>
<p>A video camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it prevents the need to collect your backyard. During a camera inspection, a sewer and drain specialist runs a video cable television down sewer branch lines that lead from bathtubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Utilizing the images captured by the camera, we can pinpoint any sewer and drain line problems, such as blockages, tree root invasion, misaligned joints, cracks, and other damage.</p>
<p>That is a sign the tank is stopping working and will need to be changed if the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank.
