<h3>Drain Cleaning Techniques in Palm Coast FL 32164</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your company' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. During periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's arguably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
