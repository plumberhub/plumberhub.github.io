<p>The U-shaped pipe underneath bathroom and kitchen sinks is something that people expect to see however rarely stop to think about. Another really essential reason to call a professional for gas line repair in Richmond is the risk of fire it poses. When gas leakages go ignored longer than they should, the gas develops and something as miniscule as an oven burner can burst the whole home into flames.
