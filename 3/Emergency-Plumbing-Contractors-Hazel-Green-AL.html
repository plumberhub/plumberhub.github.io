<p>It is necessary to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Changes in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will prompt a properly functioning RPZ assembly to periodically release small amounts of water. During a backflow condition, a large volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this factor, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be set up in areas subject to water damage. Appropriate drainage needs to also be provided.</p>
