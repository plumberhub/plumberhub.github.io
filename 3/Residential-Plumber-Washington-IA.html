<p>It is necessary to comprehend that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Variations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will trigger an appropriately functioning RPZ assembly to regularly release small amounts of water.
