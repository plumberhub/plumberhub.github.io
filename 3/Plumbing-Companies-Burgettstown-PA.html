This is especially true if you have without treatment hard water, which includes severe minerals that can connect to the piping and tank and break down the material gradually. Whether it's calcium, iron, or another aspect that is causing the rust, you will ultimately experience a leak in your hot water heater that is challenging to repair. Leaks often imply a brand-new system replacement remains in order.</p>
