<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and guaranteed and satisfy our rigid trust certification standards.

If these replacements and repairs do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of changing your faucet, then we recommend a new faucet installation.</p>

<h3>Clogged Sink in Mission Hills California</h2>
