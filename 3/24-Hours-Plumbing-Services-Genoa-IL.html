<h3>Trusted Home Plumbing Services Genoa IL</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's cable television, drain or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's DIY job. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
