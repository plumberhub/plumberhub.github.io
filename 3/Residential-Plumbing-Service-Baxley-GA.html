<h3>Do You Need Water Heater Repair in Baxley GA 31513?</h3>
<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one need to initially consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener elements. When these elements are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new salt ions.</p>

Clogged Toilet: For toilets that are badly clogged, we will snake the drain to eliminate it at last.</p>
<p>Plainly the resin is not an endless exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. Once backwashing is complete, the softener can be returned to utilize. Some water softeners will automatically change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
