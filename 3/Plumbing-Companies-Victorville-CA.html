<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a versatile supply of water line. They're a lot simpler to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make certain to get one that's covered with stainless-steel mesh. For an excellent seal, hold the hose so it aims straight into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the adapters.

If required, check for leakages and tighten them a bit more.</p>
