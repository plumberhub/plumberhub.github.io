<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming potable water supply. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical type of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
