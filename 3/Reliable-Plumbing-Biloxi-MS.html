Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your company' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capacity. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line.
