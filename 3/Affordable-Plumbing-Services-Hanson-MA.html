We have 300% more chemicals that go beyond nationwide health guidelines, and a even high portion of toxins in our water that the nationwide average. On top of that our typical water firmness level is between 18-23 grains per gallon of water or for simpleness reasons "very tough water".</p>
<p>Distribution pipes shift to even smaller specific service pipes, carrying water to specific homes, apartment or condo structures, stores and organisations. Depending upon demand, these pipes range in size from a half inch in diameter to 6 inches. Water gets in the consumer facility by means of a water meter that records circulation rates and water utilization for billing functions. Specific service pipelines are normally made from plastic, lead or Type K copper. And it is here at the point of application where the installation of a backflow preventer can be crucial.</p>
