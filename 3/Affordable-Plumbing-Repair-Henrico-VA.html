A plumbing professional can figure out whether the problem with your faucet is a quick fix or the outcome of other concerns in your home's plumbing system. More complicated issues with water temperature level or pressure may need changing the water heater, which usually costs $350-$ 3,500, depending on capacity and type.</p>
