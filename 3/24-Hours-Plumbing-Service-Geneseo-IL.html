<p>The use of different metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic rust Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever 2 different kinds of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is produced due to the fact that of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to alleviate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
