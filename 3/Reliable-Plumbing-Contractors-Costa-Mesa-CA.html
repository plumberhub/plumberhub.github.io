<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years of ages and you have to hire a plumber for that burner kit. The overall repair bill might remain in the $300 variety. A gas water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical hot water heater cost about $400 to $800). That repair expense is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyhow. Opt for the brand-new heater.</p>
