<p>If there is a leak, we will find the leak and shut the gas line down at the main line if it has not already been finished. Then, our professional will dig to discover the gas line and leak. The gas line will be changed and pressure checked to make sure there are no leaks. The site will be cleaned up and brought back to its previous splendor if the leak is sufficiently repaired.</p>
