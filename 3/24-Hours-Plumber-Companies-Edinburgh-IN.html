<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He said he would change the washers which may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no more repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my renters attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Because he had another appointment, they called him back and he stated he would not come back. A best bad plumber story.</p>

Proper care and waste disposal unit maintenance will keep it running long past its warranty and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
