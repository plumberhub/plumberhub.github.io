<h3>How Often Should Plumbing Check Temple TX</h3>
<p>A recently set up water heater should not produce strange noises, but it will start to produce rumbling sounds as it ages. The noises get louder with time as the heater runs to heat up the water.

If the water heater still produces rumbling noises even after it has been flushed, a water heater replacement might be necessary.</p>
<p>Insecticide from garden tubes: The highly poisonous insecticide chlordane was back-siphoned into the water supply. An extermination company staff member had left one end of a garden hose in a barrel of diluted insecticide and the other linked to an external house hose bibb (outside spigot). When the water system system pressure dropped due to repair work, the chlordane was drawn back through the house into the water system.</p>
