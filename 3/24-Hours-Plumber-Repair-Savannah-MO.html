<p>A sewer leak on your drain line, or main sewer line, can be tough to spot and can also harm your home. Ponding or standing water from leaking sewer lines are also a health risk and often go undiagnosed. Leaking drain pipes can also undermine your drain system and cause separations. Our plumbers typically carry out a color test to determine the source since the source of leaking water can be difficult to detect. Commonly, pipes or water service lines are replaced, only to find they were not the source of a leak. Suprisingly enough, sewer water is not constantly filthy or stained and frequently gets mistaken for a water system line leak.</p>
<p>Fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water functions need to have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. If backflows occur from them, these water features are considered a health risk. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and location must be indicated on construction plans. Any backflow preventer set up on a fountain or garden pond need to be checked upon installation and after that yearly.</p>
