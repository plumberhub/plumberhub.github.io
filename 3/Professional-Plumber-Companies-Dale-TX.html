<p>Last but not least, the most complicated and advanced backflow preventer is the lowered pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than five separately operating valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other four. During standard water flows at style pressure, the 2 check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the connected service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a advanced and reliable  (if costly) device is best used in crucial areas where cross contamination might be a direct threat to life and health.</p>
