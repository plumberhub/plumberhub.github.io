<p>If you're coping with reduced pressure from scale-ridden pipes, dry hair, stiff laundry, and endless device repair bills, you need a water softener.

<p>Never ever try a repair or garbage disposal installation by yourself. Always trust a professional to minimize the chances of injury. Your house is over 10 years old, and you have never ever had the sewer and drain lines examined. Some plumbers might get professional discounts from retailers or kitchen and bath display rooms. If you need a brand-new sink or faucet, compare their costs with what you can discover online or in your home enhancement stores. They might be getting you a much better deal</p>
<p>Replacing your flapper may require somewhat different steps than we reveal (Pictures 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube.

To discover an appropriate replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware store. (Shut off the water before getting rid of the flapper.) You may not discover an identical match, however opportunities are you'll locate one of the exact same shape and diameter. If not, attempt a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>
