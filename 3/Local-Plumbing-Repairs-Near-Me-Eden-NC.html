<p>Never attempt a repair or garbage disposal installation by yourself. Constantly trust a professional to lower the possibilities of injury. Your house is over 10 years old, and you have never had the sewer and drain lines examined. Some plumbers may get professional discount rates from sellers or kitchen and bath showrooms. Compare their expenses with what you can discover online or at house improvement shops if you need a brand-new sink or faucet. They might be getting you a better offer</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when getting ahold of the firmness minerals. But the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is widely thought of. If you have moderately difficult water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday sodium intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of salt included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
