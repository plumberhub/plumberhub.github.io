Watering backflow prevention assemblies need to be checked by a certified backflow assembly tester as the water is turned on to guarantee correct backflow prevention remains in location to secure our drinking water during the irrigation season. Denver Water will send a testing pointer notice 30 days before the annual test is due.</p>
<p>Backflow is the unfavorable turnaround of flow in a safe and clean water circulation system. Water that is always under pressure can just stream in one direction. Then how can water flow in reverse? Water will always stream toward the point of most affordable pressure.

The demand upstream could trigger a reversal in circulation.</p>
