This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been gotten rid of-- corrosive. For this factor, WQA advises that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not trigger this type of deterioration A softener is simply catching some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations in the process (generally salt or in some cases potassium).</p>
