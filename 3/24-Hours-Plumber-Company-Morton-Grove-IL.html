<p>Water softeners include value to your operation by securing your water-using devices from poor efficiency and early failure. Some tough water problems are extremely noticeable, like dispensers and sprayers becoming clogged. Other problems can go undetected, like scale on water heater components and buildup in reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. Undetectable or noticeable, these problems have actually genuine costs related to them. Clogged fixtures cause replacement or reconditioning costs and can irritate your customers. Scale buildup in your water heater will inflate your energy expenses, and prematurely harmed RO membranes will leave you with unneeded replacement expenses. Soon, these little costs can amount to make a real effect on your bottom line.</p>
<p>Changing your flapper might need a little different steps than we show (Photos 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an uncommon flush valve, finding a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the job. To find a suitable replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware store. (Switch off the water prior to removing the flapper.) You might not find a similar match, but chances are you'll locate among the exact same shape and size. If not, try a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>
