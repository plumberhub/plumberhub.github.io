<p>These valves have a great deal of versatility. They're the least pricey of the backflow prevention options, but they likewise provide the least quantity of defense. A climatic vacuum breaker, also referred to as an anti-siphon valve, stops back siphonage with a drifting disc. When pressurized and drops to permit air to get in the downstream piping when depressurized, this disc increases and seals off the air inlet.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned up rapidly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure.

<p>Polybutylene utilized inside your home can be found near the water heater or coming out of the walls to feed sinks or toilets.

You might have to make a little hole in the drywall to see the connection.</p>
