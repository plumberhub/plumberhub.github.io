<p>If you're coping with decreased pressure from scale-ridden pipes, dry hair, stiff laundry, and endless device repair costs, you need a water softener. Difficult water is not an issue that will disappear on its own and the expenses sustained by hard water will just continue to intensify.

If scale continues to collect in your pipes, your circulation rate will continue to restrict and you risk losing water pressure throughout your home. Hard water ravages hot water heater, and without a softener, your energy costs will continue to barrel skyward.

There is a leak someplace and this could be major issue if it is. Move on to the valves. Start with the main shut down valve operation. When shut off, no faucet in the house must have water. This chooses every other turned off valve and their matching faucets. You are off to a good start if everything is working effectively.</p>

<p>This post aims to resolve the common misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes corrosion This is not the case: an effectively set up water softener does not make the cured water more corrosive.
