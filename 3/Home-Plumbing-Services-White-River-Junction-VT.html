For a lot of blockages you'll just need a plunger, and in some cases some chemicals, however if this doesn't solve the problem then you might also have to contact a drain specialist like Reckon & Reckon to help. As a bathroom drain is likewise more difficult to repair and replace than a kitchen sink drain, it's more likely that you'll need a professional plumber's services.</p>
