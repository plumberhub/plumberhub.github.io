<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbing Ridgeville SC</h3>
<p>Many houses or structures that were built in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can begin to wear away. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to provide weather condition defense. As the external finish of zinc begins to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>

At the time of inspection, make sure to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can look at the entire system.
