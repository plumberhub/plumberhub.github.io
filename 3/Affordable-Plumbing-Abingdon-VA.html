This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been removed-- destructive. For this reason, WQA recommends that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not trigger this kind of corrosion A softener is simply capturing some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (generally salt or sometimes potassium).</p>
