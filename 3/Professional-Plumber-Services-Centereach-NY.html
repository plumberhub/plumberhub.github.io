<p>Light Blue = Decreased Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is minimized by the # 1 Inspect spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure distinction throughout the # 1 check valve maintains the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>

<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Photo 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on particular new sinks, however these will be labeled to that impact. Use a non-water-based silicone if you can't use plumber's putty. When you tighten the locknut in place, excess putty will squeeze out in between the new basket strainer and the sink. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to place the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without catching on the gasket.</p>
<p>Water pressure should be examined at least when a year or whenever you have a plumber in your house.
