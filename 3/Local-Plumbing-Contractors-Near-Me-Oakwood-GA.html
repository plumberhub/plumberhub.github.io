In these programs, older 3.5 and 6.0 - gallons per flush toilet components in residences were changed with 1.6 - gallons per flush models.

It's filled with small, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The brine tank is where the salt, or salt, is stored and mixed with water. If you plan to drain  your automatic dishwasher through your disposer, find the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1).
