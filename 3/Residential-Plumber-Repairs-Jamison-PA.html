That's not all, a gas leak fire also causes other gas-run devices to explode such as clothes dryer, water stoves, fireplaces, and heaters.</p>
<p>Then connect the drain (and dishwasher hose, if suitable). If your system is outlet-ready-- take note of this part-- make sure your disposal switch remains in the off" position before you plug the new system in.
