<p>The majority of homes or buildings that were constructed in the 1970s normally have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can start to rust.

As the external finish of zinc starts to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>
