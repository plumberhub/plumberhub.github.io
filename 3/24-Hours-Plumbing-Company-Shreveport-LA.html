<h3>Blocked Drains in Shreveport LA 71106 - Various Tools Used</h3>
<p>I bought a "Offer" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written estimate to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, since I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) which was just 9 months back. I feel that prices were increased because I had a "Deal". An Angie's list post from March said depending on the market and severity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Pity on me for not bringing my past invoice to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>

Whether you require aid with a small repair, a re-pipe or a remodel, you can ensure that the work will be completed the very first time accurately. Low water pressure might be due to a plethora of factors, but the most typical reasons are sediment buildup and corrosion, which both block water from going through the entire pipe and put unnecessary pressure on particular areas of pipe.</p>

Of course, similar to any major appliance, you'll want to benefit from professional installation services Lots of house owners attempt to cut corners and install their own waste disposal unit.
