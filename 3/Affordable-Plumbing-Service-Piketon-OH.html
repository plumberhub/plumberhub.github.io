To keep your sink smelling fresh and running clear, gather equivalent parts of vinegar and baking soda on a regular basis. For routine cleaning, you'll just need about one-half cup of each. Let the mix sit for a few minutes prior to running some warm water down the drain. You can also use lemon juice for the exact same function.
