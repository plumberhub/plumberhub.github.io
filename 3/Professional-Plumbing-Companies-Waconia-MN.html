<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one should initially consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener components. When these aspects are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions found in difficult water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
<p>Responsive circulation technology works by constantly bringing tanks online and off-line in response to the water needs of your carwash. For example, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation technology, only one of the four tanks is required to soften water when the carwash isn't hectic. Nevertheless, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill. This responsive design allows the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than conventional single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
