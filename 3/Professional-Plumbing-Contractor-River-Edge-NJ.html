<h3>Plumbing Repairs & Services In River Edge NJ</h3>
<p>Many houses or structures that were constructed in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. Gradually, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can start to corrode. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather condition defense. As the outer covering of zinc starts to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when searching for a feasible solution, especially when basic plunging doesn't appear to work. However, there are many drawbacks to utilizing these harmful items - not least of which is that they generally include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a blockage, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of presenting the threat of damage to your house and household.</p>
