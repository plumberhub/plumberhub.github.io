<h3>The Many Services Provided By Residential Plumbers Old Hickory TN</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's cable television, drain or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's DIY project. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
<p>Also referred to as cabling, we snake a coiled metal wire down the pipe while we turn on our end to unclog drains. This technique works best for cleaning out drains clogged with hair and particles, such as sinks and showers. Backflow is the flow of water in the wrong direction from a customer's water system into the general public water supply. Backflow might be caused by back pressure or back siphonage.</p>
