<h3>Things To Consider Before Hiring A Plumber Claremore OK</h3>
<p>A. Usually wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>If your issue is more associated to scale and mineral build-up, it is necessary to be mindful that the majority of scale and mineral build-up in toilet bowls is brought on by tough water. Hard water usually leaves lime and calcium buildup which can become quite unsightly. While phosphoric acid and other cleaning approaches will definitely help, we highly suggest you check out installing a water softener to assist with your tough water.</p>
