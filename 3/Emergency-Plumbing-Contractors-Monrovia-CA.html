<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one must first consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener parts. When these elements are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new sodium ions.</p>
