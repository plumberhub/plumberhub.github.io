<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from regular circulation instructions within a piping system that is brought on by negative pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the reversal of typical circulation in a system caused by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water supply piping). Back-siphonage can take place when there is a high speed in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is decreased main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as throughout fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions also enable options to backflow preventers. For instance, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems supplying devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water system.
