<p>But is a plumbing disaster imminent or just a concern for the long run? Changing old pipes in a 1,500 square foot, two-bathroom house expenses $4,000 to $10,000, and needs cutting open walls and floors, so you certainly do not wish to do the job prior to it's essential. Here's how to assess your plumbing system and know when it's time for replacement.</p>
<p>Plainly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the sodium exchange sites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize once backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will immediately switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
<p>Reverse osmosis uses an applied pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to conquer osmotic pressure and get rid of water particles from the solution with hardness ions. The membrane has pores large enough to confess water particles for passage; solidity ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water system is without solidity ions with no other ions being added. Membranes are a type of water filter requiring regular cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
