<p>This article intends to deal with the common misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes corrosion This is not the case: an appropriately set up water softener does not make the cured water more corrosive. Here are a few complicated facts that typically lead individuals to this incorrect conclusion. Initially, naturally soft water is usually corrosive. For that reason, softened water must also be corrosive, ideal? This is a fallacy since naturally soft water tends to be corrosive due to low pH and low TDS, while cation -exchange softening causes neither of these conditions.</p>

<h3>Water Heater Installation and Repair Tips at Douglasville GA 30135</h3>
<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one need to initially consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener components. When these components are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
<p>Need loads, no matter what their usage, must be met by a sufficiently sized water system, which makes up the second major part of a water supply system. With appropriate storage tank capacity to fulfill variable peak load need, the water system source can supply a steady circulation of water. Throughout hours of low need, the water circulation can be utilized to refill storage cisterns, tanks and towers, which then supply water for emergency use and periods when demand goes beyond the standard pumping rate. A supply of water source can take numerous forms, consisting of groundwater extraction well fields, free-flowing rivers, manufactured or natural ponds, artesian springs, ocean water desalination plants, and rainwater run-off collection systems.</p>
