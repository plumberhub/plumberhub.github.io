<h3>The Dreaded Blocked Toilet in Athens AL 35611</h3>
<p>Water that has been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been gotten rid of-- corrosive. For this factor, WQA advises that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not trigger this type of rust A softener is just catching some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations at the same time (generally salt or sometimes potassium).</p>
