<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Windsor NC 27983?</h3>
<p>Water that has been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been eliminated-- destructive. For this factor, WQA advises that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not cause this kind of corrosion A softener is just capturing some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations at the same time (usually sodium or sometimes potassium).</p>
