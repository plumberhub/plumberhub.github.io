<p>Safeguard your home from leaks. There are several things that you must consider to help you decide when you need a hot water heater replacement. An excellent basic rule of thumb is that as soon as your current hot water heater reaches its 10th birthday, you ought to begin preparing for a replacement. At this age, you will understand that it is nearing the end of its effectiveness so this is a great time to start taking a look at your replacement options. By doing this you won't have a surprise expense on your hands when the day comes that it stops working.</p>
<p>A testable backflow prevention device has 2 check valves-- generally two layers of defense.

There are a couple of others that I will point out but do not get hung up on them. I mention them just due to the fact that they will be on an accreditation test.</p>
