<p>Tankless electric water heaters come in 2 types. There are whole-house heaters that are effective and large enough to provide warm water to all bathrooms, kitchen areas, and devices in a house. On the other hand, there are the point-of-use electrical heaters that supply hot water to specific spaces or appliances just. Both whole-house and point-of-use heaters work the very same method. The only difference is the amount of water they can warm up at any given time. Likewise, whole-house systems are significantly more costly than the point of usage units.</p>
