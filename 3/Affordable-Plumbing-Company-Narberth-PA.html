<p>Water that has actually been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been gotten rid of-- corrosive.

Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not trigger this kind of corrosion A softener is simply catching some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (generally salt or often potassium).</p>
<p>Every day, the drains in your house successfully get rid of big amounts of water and waste.
