<p>The Required Inspections Table shown below lists those inspections that should be carried out to confirm that your work abides by the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Regulations. Please note that Virginia's Building regulations prohibits the use of any plumbing fixtures or devices prior to approval of all needed inspections. We hope this list is useful to you throughout the course of your task. Please call our Building Inspections Department, at 804-501-4360, if you have any questions about what is required for each inspection or if you need aid scheduling an inspection. Building, Electrical, Mechanical or Fire Protection work need additional authorizations and inspections. Separate notifications are readily available to explain the inspections needed for each type of license.</p>
<p>We supply emergency drain repair services for cracked and breached drain lines that will help you to avoid possibly larger problems in the future. Leaky and cracked drains waste water that winds up costing you money along with damaging the environment. Stopping these leakages and repairing damaged pipes is specifically crucial in an area as drought-stricken as Los Angeles where summertime water allotments are low, and costs are high.</p>
<p>Often you have to replace a sink-- when an enamel sink is severely damaged, or when any sink is leaking. And in some cases you're simply ready for a kitchen upgrade. If you want one or more sinks in your home to  have soft water for much easier dish washing, under-sink and counter top softeners can help. These localized softeners are easy to install and typically affordable, though you'll have to budget for replacement filters.</p>
<p>Broken pipes become very more pricey to fix as the rate of the flow of the broken pipe grows. And whether industrial or residential, broken pipes can cause leakage into the water supply, which can be a significant cause of issue and even an ecological danger if a sewage line is involved. All plumbing must have their tests on at the time of inspection or the plumber need to accredit the plumbing was checked on the test form on the right side of this page.</p>
