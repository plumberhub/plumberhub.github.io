<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He said he would change the washers and that might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no further repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my renters attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Due to the fact that he had another appointment, they called him back and he stated he would not come back.
