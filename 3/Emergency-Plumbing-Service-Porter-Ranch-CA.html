<p>Inspecting the water meter is a great next step in your plumbing inspection. If the water meter is turning, close all faucets and examine. If it is, there is a leak somewhere and this could be major problem. Carry on to the valves. Start with the main shut down valve operation. When shut down, no faucet in your home should have water. This chooses every other turned off valve and their corresponding faucets. You are off to a good start if whatever is working effectively.</p>
<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years old and you have to employ a plumber for that burner set. The total repair bill may be in the $300 variety. A gas hot water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical water heaters cost about $400 to $800). That repair costs is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. Opt for the brand-new heater.</p>
