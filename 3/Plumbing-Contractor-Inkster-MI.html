<p>It's Making sounds - As your water heats, there are minerals that are falling and separating to your tank's bottom. This will cause it to work harder and can create sound. If your energy expenses are rising, a brand-new, greater effectiveness water heater can bring them back down.

After that the softener can be disconnected, moved to its brand-new location and positioned there.</p>
