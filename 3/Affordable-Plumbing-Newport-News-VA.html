A house's service line (also referred to as a sewer lateral) ranges from your house to the mainline sewer in the street. In many cases, the property owner is accountable for keeping the service line from the house to the curb, and the City is responsible for preserving the mainline sewer and the portion of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>

If you have a clogged drain, it is incredibly important that you do not attempt to unclog it yourself because this might potentially cause a large leak and more costly repairs.</p>
