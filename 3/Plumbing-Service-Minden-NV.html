<p>Even for a non-steel plumbing system, age will ultimately take its toll. If you notice that your plumbing experiences numerous obstructions, leaks, and water pressure variation that no amount of repairs appears to stem, you must speak with a reliable plumber about whole-house repiping as a service.

<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer set will be attached to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws originally meant for the disposer discharge elbow. If your set just consists of a waste arm, it is possible - though not advised - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint.

Depending on the length of the waste arm, you may be able to cut off its elbow and use the remainder as a straight discharge tube.</p>
