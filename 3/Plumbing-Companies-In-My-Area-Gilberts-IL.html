When purchasing a home or flat, having a plumbing inspection is quite standard. If it's a leasing I have actually not seen a plumbing inspection done.  Once again I have not seen electrical take any sort of precidence over plumbing. In truth, if not done it can be among the most expensive repair projects if overlooked.

<p>Nearly all softeners fall under one of two classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will restore on a predetermined schedule and after that return to service. These work well for households that are on routine water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt due to the fact that they restore whether the resin requires it or not. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, usually regenerate after a lot of gallons of water have been softened. Such designs are practical if you have a fluctuating water use schedule.</p>
