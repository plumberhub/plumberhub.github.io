<p>Milwaukee, WI - Oct. 12, 2017 - SofTap Water, Inc., a Cincinnati water technology start-up, and a graduate of The Water Council's BREW Corporate Accelerator program in Milwaukee WI, revealed today they have actually accomplished a breakthrough in water softening treatment using a proprietary Surface area Accelerated Condensation (SACr) innovation. SACr physically eliminates short-term hardness without utilizing chemicals or high pressure, which are major constraints of current softening innovations.</p>
