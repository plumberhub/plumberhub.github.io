<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capacity. Throughout periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's arguably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>

Many plumbers charge between $45 and $65 per hour, with most disposal installations running $50 per hour for three hours total, making the labor expenses approximately $150.</p>
