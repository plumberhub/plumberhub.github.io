<p>The issue of leakage can be attributed to any number of elements which can range from the tank is old and worn, to over-pressurization, along with poor maintenance. When heating the water, the water heater tank must have some room to account for the expansion that takes place. The thermal growth needs to leave, thus the need for a growth tank to help control the pressure. If the tank is old and worn, the force applied by the expansion taking place when boiling the water causes the tank to crack and start leaking. The treatment for this is to replace the water heater unit.</p>
