<p>Mounted under the sink, the waste disposal unit is meant for chopping up smidgens of waste food.

<p>So Professional!!!! I am so impressed with this company. They reacted to a hot water heater issue at my business within thirty minutes of me calling.

<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years old and you need to employ a plumber for that burner kit. The total repair bill may be in the $300 variety. A gas hot water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical water heaters cost about $400 to $800). That repair bill is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyhow. Opt for the new heater.</p>
