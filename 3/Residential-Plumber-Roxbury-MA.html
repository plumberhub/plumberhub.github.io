<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. However the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is commonly thought of. If you have reasonably hard water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday salt intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of salt included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
