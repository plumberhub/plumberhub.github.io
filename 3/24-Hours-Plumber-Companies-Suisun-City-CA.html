<p>The normal solution is to have the defective pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is an option to consider if you reside in an older home - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for many years, however steel ultimately experiences deterioration and does not have the durability of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
