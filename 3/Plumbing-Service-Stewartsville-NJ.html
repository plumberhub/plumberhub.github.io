<h3>Commercial Plumbing Services, Available 24/7 Stewartsville NJ</h3>
<p>Though water line replacement sounds like your home's equivalent of major surgery, it's actually something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with frequently. When your water lines are repiped, it simply indicates old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with new pipes. We find that houses 15 years or older who have actually never had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement.

We discover that repiping can really be the cheaper and much better long-lasting solution if you do have frequent leaks.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. But the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is extensively envisioned. If you have reasonably tough water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily salt consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of sodium added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
