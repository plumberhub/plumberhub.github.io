Excess putty will eject in between the new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten the locknut in location. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to place the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
