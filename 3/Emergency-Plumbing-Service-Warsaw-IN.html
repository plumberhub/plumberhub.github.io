No matter what kinds of repairs, maintenance, or installation services you need, let our Atlanta water heater specialists deal with the details so that you can return to typical life with hot water. So-called tough" water is the outcome of ground water going through and dissolving rocks and minerals, which then release calcium and magnesium ions. These liquified ions give difficult water its attributes.</p>
