<p>Template-Assisted Formation: Shortened to TAC, this method utilizes resin beads as a catalytic nucleation site where hardness mineral ions are changed into a stable crystalline kind that will not cling to surfaces.

<p>Run the warm water. Hot water is your good friend, especially for your kitchen sink.

For example, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems providing devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water system. This gets rid of the need for a backflow preventer, due to the fact that each time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
