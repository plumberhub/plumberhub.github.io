<p>Roto-Rooter has actually remained in the drain cleaning business since 1935, when Samuel Blanc patented the first electric drain cleaning machine and established the very first Roto-Rooter franchise. Today, the technology hasn't changed much from Blanc's timeless development, and uses blades to cut through debris to restore proper water flow.</p>
<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal service is to have the faulty pipes replaced. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is a choice to consider if you live in an older home - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for lots of decades, however steel eventually suffers from deterioration and lacks the resilience these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
