<p>As soon as a big enough source of water has actually been determined and evaluated, the third major part of a supply of water system enters play: a system of pipelines to communicate the water from its source to its customers. The biggest of these main long-distance sending pipes are referred to as aqueducts. Generally constructed of large-diameter (10 feet or more) enhanced concrete pipe sectors, and even tunnels lined with an impenetrable coating, these are huge underground and aboveground pipes created to bring bulk flow quantities of water to treatment plants, secondary storage centers and distribution nodes where the circulations are moved to smaller-sized branch distribution pipelines. The majority of big cities need a number of aqueducts supplying water from diverse and geographically separated sources.</p>
