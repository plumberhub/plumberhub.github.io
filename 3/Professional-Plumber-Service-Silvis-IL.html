Rather than removing the clog with unfavorable pressure, it in fact presses into the clog, working even more into where the obstruction is happening. The auger or snake" is then used to press the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear course for water to flow freely. The auger's corkscrew-shaped pointer helps require it further down into the clog, making it simpler to clear.</p>
