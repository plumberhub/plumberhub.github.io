<p>Some hot water heater problems are small enough to be successfully addressed with professional repairs. Things like a dark pilot light, tripped circuit breaker, broken burner, or sediment accumulation are all easy and fairly affordable to attend to. However, particular problems with your water heater might indicate that it's time for a replacement. Our Wheaton plumbers can help you identify which course of action is best for you.</p>

As a bathroom drain is also harder to repair and replace than a kitchen sink drain, it's more likely that you'll need a professional plumber's services.</p>
