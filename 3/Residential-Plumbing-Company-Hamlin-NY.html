<p>Caution: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is utilized on a lot of rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts down. Due to the fact that the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system, this is. The likelihood of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB.
