<p>Reduced pressure zone assemblies (RPZ), also called reduced pressure concept assemblies, are the market standard for any type of commercial property, consisting of apartment and condos, due to the fact that they provide the highest level of defense versus toxins and contaminants. Reduced pressure zone assemblies are the most complicated and costly backflow valves to install; however, when installed correctly, these are the best and most reliable backflow valves offered.

<p>Milwaukee, WI - Oct. 12, 2017 - SofTap Water, Inc., a Cincinnati water innovation start-up, and a graduate of The Water Council's BREW Corporate Accelerator program in Milwaukee WI, revealed today they have attained a development in water softening treatment using a proprietary Surface area Accelerated Formation (SACr) technology. SACr physically eliminates short-lived hardness without using chemicals or high pressure, which are significant constraints of existing softening innovations.</p>
