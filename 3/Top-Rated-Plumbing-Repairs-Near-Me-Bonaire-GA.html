<h3>The Importance of Drain Cleaning and How it Affects Your Home in Bonaire GA 31005</h3>
<p>A water softener has 2 tanks: a mineral tank and a salt water tank. The mineral tank is where the actual ion exchange, or water softening, happens. It's filled with little, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The salt water tank is where the sodium, or salt, is saved and blended with water. If you prepare to drain  your automated dishwasher through your disposer, find the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Eliminate it by gently punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). Leave the breakout plate intact if you will not use your system to drain a dishwasher.</p>

It might be time to call on a professional from Atlas Plumbing to investigate when this takes place.</p>
