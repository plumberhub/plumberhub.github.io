<h3>Helpful Tips For Selecting A Reputable, Budget Friendly Plumber Norfolk MA</h3>
<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not recede against the required instructions of flow. When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to guarantee that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the community water system, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water held in the lawn sprinkler can end up being infected. If enabled to re-enter the supply of water, there is potential for the polluted water to become a health hazard. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected regularly for effectiveness, as well as examined yearly by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
