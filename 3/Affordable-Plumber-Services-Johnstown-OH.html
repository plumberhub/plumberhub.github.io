It is again essential for the repair specialist to be aware of the hardness of the materials so that their cleaning process is not harmful. In the bigger backflow prevention assemblies (2 - 10") the iron bodies will be covered to minimize any scale growth or deterioration. It is important that the repair specialist is sensitive to the hardness and type of the different finishes used on iron body systems so as not to harm the protective finishing.</p>

<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. But the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is widely pictured. If you have moderately tough water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day sodium consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of sodium added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
