<p>The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, however it does not grind up food, this suggests the flywheel is stuck. Try releasing the jam by inserting a hex wrench of the appropriate size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit. Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the usual option is to have the faulty pipes replaced. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in.
