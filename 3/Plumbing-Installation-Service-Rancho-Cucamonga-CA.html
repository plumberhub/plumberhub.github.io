Sounds good, doesn't it? What if we informed you that you could do all of that with a tankless, saltless water softener? Well, with NuvoH2O environmentally friendly water supply for homes, you can.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes without any neighboring utilities or obstructions, digging through and changing the pipe by hand would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. Nevertheless, if your damaged pipe runs under your driveway, any large trees or pathways, dig-free pipe lining might conserve you as much as $10,000 in repair expenses, if not more. Set a pail under the P-trap and disconnect the drainpipes. Then remove the sink strainer. Remove any excess putty.</p>
