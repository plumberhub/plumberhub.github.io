<h3>Plumbing Repairs & Services In Dillsburg PA</h3>
<p>You can relax and use your gas piping without any worry when we manage your gas or gas pipe installation and gas pipe repair. While water overuse is an issue for your wallet, it's also a problem for the environment. Old-fashioned water softening systems that aren't saltless can consume to 25 gallons of water every day for their regeneration process. That's 700 gallons of water a month just to keep your water softener up and running.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. But the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is extensively pictured. If you have reasonably tough water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily salt intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of salt included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
