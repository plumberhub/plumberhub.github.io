<p>Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water supply react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become brittle. This results in micro-fractures and minimizes the basic structural stability of the system. The system ends up being weak and may stop working without caution, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Incorrect installation is likewise a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly difficult to detect.</p>
<p>The most basic mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc connected to a climatic vent. In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outside air. This activates the disc to open, allowing air to enter the valve and restore pressure equivalent to ambient climatic standard. This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
