<h3>How To Repair Your Water Heater at Portage PA 15946</h3>
<p>A water softener has 2 tanks: a mineral tank and a salt water tank. The mineral tank is where the actual ion exchange, or water softening, happens. It's filled with small, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The brine tank is where the sodium, or salt, is saved and mixed with water. If you plan to drain  your automatic dishwasher through your disposer, find the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Remove it by gently punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). Leave the breakout plate undamaged if you will not use your system to drain a dishwasher.</p>
