The pre-programmed number represents the amount of time in between each regrowth. For instance, a lower picked number implies your softener will restore less typically. Attempt choosing a lower number up until you discover one that fulfills your requirements if you are experiencing discolorations. Demand-initiated softeners are more popular and effective than time-initiated softeners.</p>
