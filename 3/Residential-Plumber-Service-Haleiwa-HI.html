<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic deterioration Direct contact in between different metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever 2 different kinds of metal are conductively connected to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is developed because of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact between the different metals.
