<p>Before installing, your professional will shut off water and electrical energy to the area. Next, the old sink flange is removed and cleaned of any putty residue. Then, a new installing ring is set up to the bottom of the sink, the sink drain is linked, and the disposal is connected to its mount. In this technique, water is treated with a calculated amount of washing soda (Na2CO3) which transforms the chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium into their respective carbonates which get precipitated.</p>
