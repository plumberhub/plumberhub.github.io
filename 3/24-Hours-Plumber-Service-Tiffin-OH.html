<p>Tough water use might impact the performance of household devices. When warmed, calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate settle out of suspension (precipitate) from the water and form a mineral deposit at the bottom of the hot water heater. A large scale buildup slows the heating procedure and requires more energy to heat water. Hot water heater with big build-ups of mineral accumulation will have a much shorter life expectancy. Scale deposits likewise accumulate to plug plumbing components and build up in other appliances such as coffee pots and dishwashing machines, therefore impacting their efficiency.</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions also allow alternatives to backflow preventers. For instance, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems providing dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water system. This gets rid of the need for a backflow preventer, due to the fact that every time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
