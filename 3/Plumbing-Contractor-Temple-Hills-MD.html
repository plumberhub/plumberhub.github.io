The number of extra hours you work every week depends on the construction sector and region you work in, and will differ from one job to the next. Over time, the limescale accumulation caused by difficult water can cause pricey plumbing repairs. A RainSoft water conditioner can help avoid early wear and tear on your toilet.</p>
