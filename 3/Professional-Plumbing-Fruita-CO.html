<p>For shallow pipes without any close-by utilities or blockages, digging through and changing the pipe by hand would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. Nevertheless, if your damaged pipe runs under your driveway, any large trees or sidewalks, dig-free pipe lining might save you as much as $10,000 in repair expenses, if not more. Set a pail under the P-trap and detach the drains. Then remove the sink strainer. Remove any excess putty.</p>
