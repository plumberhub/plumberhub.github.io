<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. In time, the deposits accumulate, till they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits occur more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. If you want to make two times as sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it, you might have your drain pipes expertly cleaned up. It's time for a new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs.</p>
