<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the usual solution is to have the faulty pipes replaced. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping is available in.

Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for numerous decades, but steel ultimately experiences corrosion and does not have the resilience of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
