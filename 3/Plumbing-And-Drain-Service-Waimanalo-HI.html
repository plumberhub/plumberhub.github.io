For water pressure to be appropriate, the lines need to be 3/4" to one inch directly from the main water source for the house. The pipes themselves need to be at least a 1/2" in diameter to provide appropriate circulation.</p>
<p>To link a power cord to the brand-new system, remove the electrical cover plate on the bottom of the disposer and join the colored wires discovered inside with their counterparts in the cord, utilizing wire nuts.
