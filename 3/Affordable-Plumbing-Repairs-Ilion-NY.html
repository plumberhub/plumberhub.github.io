<p>The easiest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc connected to a climatic vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop listed below that of the outdoors air. This triggers the disc to open, allowing air to enter the valve and restore pressure equivalent to ambient atmospheric requirement. This repair of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>

<p>Difficult water is triggered by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners deal with the water by utilizing salt and ion-exchange resins to eliminate these minerals. When the water can be found in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions transfer out of the water and onto the active sites on the resin. Then they are replaced in the solution by the sodium ions.</p>
