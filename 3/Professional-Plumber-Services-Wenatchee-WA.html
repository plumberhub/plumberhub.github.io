<p>How to install or replace a garbage disposal. Regular drain inspections and cleansings are suggested every 3 years or two. Appropriate maintenance is key to extending the life of your pipe system.

<p>Get rid of electrical cover plate and detach the disposal from the electrical connections. Rock salt contains a great deal of matter that is not water-soluble.
