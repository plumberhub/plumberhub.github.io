<p>2 styles of PVBs are available: (1) Pressure Vacuum Breaker and (2) Spill Resistant Vacuum Breaker. A PVB is a mechanical backflow prevention assembly that includes an individually acting, spring-loaded check valve and an individually acting, spring-loaded, air inlet valve on the discharge side of the check valve. It consists of shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is equipped with test dicks. A PVB might be utilized to isolate health or non-health threats but is effective versus back-siphonage only.</p>
