<h3>Residential Water Heater Repair and Replacement in North Versailles PA 15137</h3>
<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one should first consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener components. When these elements are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new salt ions.</p>
<p>Responsive circulation technology works by continually bringing tanks off-line and on-line in reaction to the water demands of your carwash. For example, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive flow technology, only one of the four tanks is needed to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. Nevertheless, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill up. This responsive design enables the MTS to consume to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than conventional single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
