<p>When the test results reveal the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated throughout the repair process. It is very important that the plumbing system be switched on extremely gradually to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air must be gotten rid of from the plumbing system.

When the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are completely open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
