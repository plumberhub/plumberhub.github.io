<p>Difficult water is caused by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners treat the water by utilizing salt and ion-exchange resins to eliminate these minerals. When the water comes in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions move out of the water and onto the active sites on the resin. Then they are changed in the service by the sodium ions.</p>
<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the typical service is to have the defective pipes changed. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is a choice to consider if you live in an older house - such as one built pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for many years, however steel eventually suffers from deterioration and lacks the resilience of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
