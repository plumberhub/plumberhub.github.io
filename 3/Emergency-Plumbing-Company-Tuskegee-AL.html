When your water lines are repiped, it just means old copper and galvanized pipes are replaced with new pipes. We find that houses 15 years or older who have never had repiping work are the most likely prospects for water line replacement. You could be in need of water line repiping if you have an older home and are experiencing regular and major leakages. We discover that repiping can really be the less expensive and much better long-term option if you do have regular leaks.</p>
