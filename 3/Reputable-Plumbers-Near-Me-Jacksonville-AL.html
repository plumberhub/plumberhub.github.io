<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one should initially consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener components. When these elements are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in difficult water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new sodium ions.</p>
