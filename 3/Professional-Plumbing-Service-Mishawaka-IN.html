<p>If you're dealing with reduced pressure from scale-ridden pipes, dry hair, stiff laundry, and limitless appliance repair bills, you need a water softener.

With a water softener, home appliances will undoubtedly fail earlier than their expected life-span. If scale continues to build up in your pipes, your flow rate will continue to restrict and you risk losing water pressure throughout your home.
