<h3>24 Hour Plumber & Water Heater Services Crown Point IN</h3>
<p>A freshly set up water heater need to not produce weird sounds, but it will begin to create rumbling noises as it ages. The sounds get louder with time as the heater goes to warm the water. Things intensify significantly for households with a high demand for hot water. The factors for the noises can be the buildup of sediments in the tank which need to be flushed to bring back normalcy. A water heater replacement may be essential if the water heater still produces rumbling sounds even after it has actually been flushed.</p>
