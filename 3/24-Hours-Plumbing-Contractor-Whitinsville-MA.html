<p>We focus on storm drain inspections and cleaning. A lot of kitchen sink clogs are because of heavy grease buildup and food particles.

<p>Loose flanges are normally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws just won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best option depends on the level of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
