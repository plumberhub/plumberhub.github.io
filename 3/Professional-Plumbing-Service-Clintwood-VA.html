<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. But the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is commonly envisioned. If you have reasonably tough water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day sodium consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of sodium added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
